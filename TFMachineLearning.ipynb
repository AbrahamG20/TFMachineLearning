better to find out if all but one testing had any appreciable value it looks like it doesn t so i ll forget about it another area for potentially fruitful study it s clear that the highest value

report  those  people mail out   e mails each for a total of   e mails the   response to that is  orders for report  those  people send   e mails each for a total of  million e mails sent out the   response is   orders for report  those   people send out   e mails each for a total of     million e mails the   response to that is   orders for report  that s   orders times  each    half a million dollars your total income in this example is              grand total    numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only  people ordering out of   you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed   e mails each or more there are over  million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day believe me many people will do just that and more method  by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method  and add method  as you go along for every  you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report available reports the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only notes always send  cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least  sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal

times sent to me by my dad   claim president george w bush proclaimed the problem with the french is that they don t have a word for entrepreneur origins yet another french fried george w bush is dumb story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures drawn in stark bold lines according to scuttlebutt that emerged in the british press in july  president bush britain s prime minister tony blair and france s president jacques chirac were discussing economics and in particular the decline of the french economy the problem with the french bush afterwards confided in blair is that they don t have a word for entrepreneur the source was shirley williams also known as the baroness williams of crosby who claimed my good friend tony blair had recently regaled her with this anecdote in brighton lloyd grove of the washington post was unable to reach baroness williams to gain her confirmation of the tale but he did receive a call from alastair campbell blair s director of communications and strategy i can tell you that the prime minister never heard george bush say that and he certainly never told shirley williams that president bush did say it campbell told the post if she put this in a speech it must have been a joke this is far from the first time bush has been made the butt of a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than stellar intellectual abilities without straining our memories too hard we can come up with three other instances we ve chronicled on this site in the summer of  the joke of the moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the ranking of presidential iqs with george w bush being pegged as the chief executive who scraped the bottom of the intelligence barrel in december  it was a fake nostradamus quatrain which pontificated that the village idiot would win the  presidential election and in the spring of  it was the story of bush s waving at stevie wonder that set folks to chortling up their sleeves stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual shortcoming will always waft after george w bush because they seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this public figure that

________________________________________________ end of list of five names step  these guides will be emailed to you save these guides on your computer s hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers step  from the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under guide  and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide  s slot be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown check the address again step  delete name and address under guide  and replace with the name and address from guide  s slot step  delete name and address under guide  and replace with the name and address from guide  s slot step  delete name and address under guide  and replace with the name and address from guide  s slot step  delete name and address under guide  and replace with your own name and address this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the guides eventually your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached guide  and then be dropped from the list the key point is that the number of people ordering guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes step  once you have completed this new list send out this new email which shows your name under guide  to as many email addresses as possible as many as   emails or even more the greater the number of mailings you make potentially the greater the number of people who will order the guide  from you these people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under guide  and so on this is all you need to do if you wish to read the rest of this email message then do so if not just do the  steps shown above remember the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step  and to encourage and help those who purchase the guides from you to send out emails of their own do not change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you your immediate reaction might be why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers if the people you slip into that list aren t going to be sending new emails you re only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted there wouldn t be new buyers coming in so your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason don t do it to others remember honesty reaps the reward you may have a concern that after sending the total  to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the guide well rest assured as we said above it s to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers so don t think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for   the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer don t cheat provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit end of summary rest of message with easy to use email tools and opt in email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before and the earnings potential is staggering read this email to the end follow what it says and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of these before either one day

and that you and those involved send out only   emails each let s also assume that the mailing receives only a     of  response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only   also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only   each out of your   emails and a   response that is only  orders for guide  those  people who responded also send out   emails each for a total of   out of those   emails only   responded with orders that s  people who responded and ordered guide  those  people mail out   e mails each for a total of   emails the

emails the   response to that is   orders for guide  or   at  per guide this may seem a small amount to you but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out see what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly if response rate is   income from guides   is           as above if response rate is   income from guides   is           if response

can see the power of leveraging that is how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate there are over  million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day method  placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are many free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response we strongly suggest you start with method  and add method  as you go along for every  you receive all you must do is email the guide the buyer ordered always provide same day service the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address in return when others buy the guides from you you also should help those buyers to resell the guides to their email addresses this will benefit you because your name would be further down the list and their new buyers will buy from you this is no different than customer service in the retail or the bricks and mortars business available guides the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each guide by its number name only always send a single  bill u s currency for each guide checks not accepted make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least  sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the guide you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper

nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers yes some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes and isps have won some theft of service suits but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles so i can t understand how daniel can assert that you can t track spammers down when it s never really been tried please don t misquote me i did not assert that you can t track spammers here is what i said it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone in various non friendly countries where spam originates china is a good example even if they do officially respect copyright law i understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers but that does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox it is an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient to counteract the ease with which a  score on the mark allows spam to avoid being tagged as spam daniel it s easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non spammers and to place all violators on the hil then i

suing the spammers for copyright infringement sorry that just can t work if the habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non spam and effectively enforced enough to be absent from spam such that e g sa could assign a positive score to messages that do not have it then spammers are out of business and habeas has no one to sue there s nobody left to charge except the people who want or are forced against their will because their mail won t get through otherwise to use the mark conversely if there are enough spammers forging the mark for habeas to make all its income suing them then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed either way it seems to me that after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of cease and desist letters to clueless mom pops then either a they re out of business b they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders or c they ve both created and monopolized a market for internet postage stamps that everybody has to pay them for the latter would be quite a coup if they could pull it off they do absolutely nothing useful unless you consider threatening people with

political ads don t have to disclose who funded them in an advisory opinion issued thursday the fec also suggested such messages include either a phone number or web site link so people could easily learn who paid for the message however the additional information won t be required the opinion could encourage the adoption of text based political ads as campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters at the same time opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous political spam target wireless a small new jersey based wireless media company had asked the fec for an opinion on the matter saying that requiring financial disclosures on short messaging service sms mailings would use up too much of the  character maximum political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from the financial disclosure requirement target wireless petition was supported by the national republican senatorial committee the cellular telecommunications and internet

more voters we have tried very hard not to get in the way particularly before everyone understands how the technology is going to work he said opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political messages while remaining anonymous biersack said the fec can revisit the issue if those problems surface target

some real movement towards improving that situation i was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on xml some took for granted that xslt was relevant to content management others took it just as for granted that xslt was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore xml almost completely i attended realizing that content management is generally used to apply to web content management but i was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was almost no consideration of the potential print pdf dimension to content other than the occasional and you can use fop to make pdf as if that was functional this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management and probably makes xml easier to ignore if html is the be all and end all of the output the honesty was refreshing phil suh complained about the state of current tools both open source and commercial and i wish i d written down what he said something like it sucks so extremely it sucks so widely and it is so generally sucking that it seems sometimes there is no hope for a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial big boys

first computer to crack enigma was optical computing with interference patterns etc makes perfect sense but enigma was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially enigma machines and brute forcing look for zygalski sheets by koerner s narrative it wound up being a hybrid affair bletchley had mock enigmas which cycled through the enigma s k starting positions in a quarter of an hour but the germans started using a plugboard which then had  x  possibilities the poles noticed that there were some patterns in the messages which were only possible via certain plugboard settings and so when we have collected several such cards corresponding to different initial signals we place them in a pile so that the squares corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a light beneath the pile only those squares which let the light through will correspond to possible daily settings so the brute force hardware allowed precalculation of optical computing devices which then narrowed down the possibilities enough for brute force to again be used for daily decodes until on  may the germans invaded france and on the same day in accordance with the best cryptographic principles they changed their enigma procedures in such a way that the  zygalski sheets each with their carefully drilled  or so holes became just so much waste cardboard dave the first synthetic aperture radar processor was optical this is also easy to believe given dr elachi s description of the  shuttle imaging radar the received signal is recorded on an optical film which is retrieved after landing the film is then processed in an optical correlator to generate the final image which makes sense as one wishes to shift each component of the return in proportion to its frequency for which one presumably needs a glorified prism alternatively the signal can be digitized and then recorded on board or transmitted to the ground via a digital data link this was the case with the sensor

right as rain on pricing i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eye s which can instantly share what they see amongst each other that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on their phones or that people will spend more time w images than voice just that it is fundamental from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order and yes changes things big time rgds rob original message from

content who cares about content that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous i d guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day i d have a different opinion of this i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made how many people do you know who communicate by pictures sure it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i don t buy it for most messages text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism for some messages pictures do the job but i would say not nearly as often as words why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about  hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didn t take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle again this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just don t understand kids today and they ll run with this i wasn t saying that mms wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t easy i was saying that i couldn t see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications i m looking for the compelling reason even if it s a stupid one why people would want to do this sure if they integrate cameras into the phone and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people but mostly i don t see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone s email address or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i don t think  hour photos are trivial people want to see their own pics right away and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots that s one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on the instant view part i m guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view but also instant show which is what this service offers i m not convinced that most people want instant show i think people like to package their pictures and show them that s why people put together fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture sure occasionally instant show is nice but it s just nice on occasion i still can t see how it becomes a integral messaging method what s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another there has to be some benefit even if it s silly if people are going to flock to it i m searching no one has given me a straight answer yet the only really intriguing idea i ve heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones from all different angles and those photos tell the real story of what happened before the press even gets there willing to be proven wrong mike ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are then mms is never going to catch on  ', ' oh my janitor boom boom boom the best place for new music is right where it s always been

that the mere knowledge of known plaintext a corresponding input and output does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly designed systems and or algorithm the primary reason it was easy for css is because the css key was only  bits and thereby easy to break with exhaustive search attacks it was only  bits speculated because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export rules at the time even more interesting to me at least was that soon after the xing player break people started studying the css algorithm itself they rapidly found serious design flaws which left the  bit css algorithm with an actual strength of around  bits from memory and new attacks might have further reduced the strength this is another great example showing why proprietary cryptography

consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect while there is no such thing as unbreakable adding more cost both in terms of price and hassle factor can greatly improve the protection

sick that they killed an innocent animal which doesn t even know the concept of god sateesh tom tomwhore slack net wrote hindus mourn monkey god by omer farooq bbc reporter in hyderabad hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a hindu god in the southern indian state of andhra pradesh the monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over zealous worshippers the animal was cremated in anantapur district  kilometres  miles south of the state capital hyderabad on sunday it had not eaten for three weeks last rites were performed by priests in the village of timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the hindu monkey god hanuman garlanded one animal rights activist said his group s efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people the monkey s death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple but were prevented by villagers the monkey which was found perched on top of an idol of hanuman a month ago attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages as well as from the neighbouring state of karnataka devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock exploited locals said they believed that lord hanuman was visiting the village as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents but animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated they filed a petition in the state s high court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple the group also alleged that people s religious feelings were being exploited to make money the court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time __________________________________________________ do you yahoo yahoo finance get real time stock quotes  ', 'new page    finally a newsfeed that

due to the layout the more tag on the second row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except about two dozen third world countries o even worse ever time you hit submit all forms based things complain about using the universal country phone number format and will cause you to re enter dashes instead of dots o when you get something that s not entered right you will go back and enter it right but then some other field or most likely pulldown will automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to go back and resent that freaking thing too finally after all

systems a goal similar to those of most rivals making computers which manage networks emc corp announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage resources as a pool hewlett packard co has a utility data center designed for broader management international business machines corp s project eliza is working to make computers self healing when systems break applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the whole idea behind n is you stop thinking about that you don t think about what box it is running on sun vice president steve mackay head of the n program said in an interview on the sidelines of a sun user conference many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or water as a utility that can be turned on or off in whatever volume one wants whenever needed for that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly rather than cobbling them together with tenuous links as most networks do today experts say there are still major barriers though such as communications standards for machines from different vendors to interoperate closely sun promised to deliver a virtualization engine that would let administrators look at their entire network as a pool by the end of the year network administrators today often have no automatic system to report what is in the network it ll tell you what you have and how it is laid out promised mackay the second stage beginning in  would allow users to identify a service such as online banking and allocate resources for them with a few clicks sun

mailing list rpm list   ', 'on wed    at   frank bergmann wrote a more reasonable explication of the eu us differences according to some american journalist cited in a german magazine can someone help me is that the american public perceives the rest of the world basically as a thread against which you have to defend yourself using power this is not a correct assessment the american public couldn t care less however the us intelligence community correctly perceives a threat and it isn t the third world many european and other developed nations aggressively engage in covert operations against american interests its been going on for years and isn t even news things have stepped up in recent years and the us dod is none too pleased for better or worse the us is relatively good at that game too as with most backwater wars they are proxies for the interests of the big players find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the us you ll find that half the countries on that list are european most people are unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years on the other hand the europeans are used to the peace of their cozy post war system where external security is not an issue all security threads can be resolved by giving money to the threatening people and to integrate them into the wealthy sphere balkan palestinians bullshit the european governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition obviously some more than others us specops are often brought in to do dirty work inside europe for european governments usually with government advisors along for the mission i ve always wondered what the deal was such that we got involved at all the point being that we ve acted as assassins for european governments inside their borders against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments and in recent years not ancient history i know specop guys who left the military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these missions while they were posted for that duty i m certainly glad i was never assigned missions in that theater because there is a lot of covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly european democracies regardless giving money to people that threaten you has never created meaningful peace in the history of civilization we call it extortion under any other guise a lot of the current eu us issues can be explained by this difference of perception such as the current american unilateralism nobody wants to help us the american arrogance towards europe they don t want to do anything so why should we ask them and the growing rejection of the american policy in europe they want to abolish the law europe is looking increasingly like a basket case whatever problems the us is having these days europe looks worse and is going downhill faster why the us would want to emulate european behavior or the european way of doing things is beyond me the us asking for major policy advice from europe is like asking a quack for medical advice i really don t see what is wrong with unilateral anyway why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff i hope the incessant knee jerk conformist screeching that americans see coming from europe doesn t actually represent the views of europeans for various reasons i m not exactly a cheerleader for the us government but the premises of the argument against them here are lame my personal point is that few americans percentage of overall population have ever left their country while even german construction workers regularly spend their holidays in spain so i m not surprised that paranoia is growing i m betting you are underestimating the actual percentage the vast majority of people i know have lived worked and traveled outside the country at one time or another and i doubt europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the western hemisphere as americans have despite the best efforts of france europe is still not the center of the universe i ll throw you a bone though most americans do consider europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it but from the perspective of an american how could you not look at it this way the impact of europe on america has diminished greatly over the years i love the smell of euro chauvinism in the morning first you assume that the north american continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous anybody that has actually traveled throughout north america knows this isn t true there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the us alone never mind the hundreds of diverse regional sub populations some of which are truly foreign apparently europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture that would be like saying mexico is culturally identical to spain because they nominally speak the same language a wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in san francisco despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country if i want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays i ll go to oakland new orleans or similar they are far more different from where i live than some countries i ve traveled to and a lot of these places are farther from where i live than spain is from germany second the state i live in is the size of germany when i travel to a neighboring state which i do regularly how is this not equivalent in fact i probably travel much farther for the holidays than your german construction workers if you look at the eu as a single country only then does your analogy become comparable what kind of ridiculous superiority do europeans get from having relatively tiny countries in truth i find europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the us there are a lot of cultural similarities across the eu with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the us the only real difference is that europeans have dozens of different languages which is hardly something i would call an advantage although there are a couple parts of the us where i can t understand a word they are saying either james rogers jamesr  ', 'url  date not supplied the antikythera mechanism recovered off a sunken ship in greece in  is thought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial bodies new analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked cool the greeks believed in an earth centric universe and accounted for celestial bodies motions using elaborate models based on epicycles in which each body describes a circle the epicycle around a point that itself moves in a circle around the earth mr wright found evidence that the antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of the sun and moon accurately using an epicyclic model devised by hipparchus and of the planets mercury and venus using an epicyclic model derived by apollonius of perga these models which predate the mechanism were subsequently incorporated into the work of claudius ptolemy in the second century ad a device that just modelled the motions of the sun moon mercury and venus does not make much sense but if an upper layer of mechanism had been built and lost these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the three other planets known at the time mars jupiter and saturn in other words the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of

runner is actually not that difficult not surprisingly it involves running there s other stuff too eventually but running is the important part if you can run a mile run a mile if you can only run around the block run around the block tomorrow you ll run around the block and the next day you ll find you can run around two blocks and next week you ll find you can run a mile then one day you ll run a mile then stop to catch your breath then get invigorated and run another mile and then you re a runner that s it really it s not complicated you run and you run and you run and one day you discover that shoes are important and that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running thing out aren t actually very good for running so you go buy new shoes and you run and you run and you run and later you discover that stretching is important too so you stretch and run and stretch and run and stretch and run there s other stuff too but it doesn t really matter until you re already a runner you learn about differences in running surfaces and how many miles you should really put on one pair of shoes and when in the day you should run to maximize calorie burning and how to train for a marathon and so forth don t worry about any of that now just run running is key otherwise you re just another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _runner s world_ ',

nearly  years ago has seen the nation s capital city successfully attacked but one year ago president george w bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the st century this is the president s story of september th and the week america went to war  minutes ii spent two hours with mr bush one on air force one and another in the oval office last week even after a year the president is still moved sometimes to the point of tears when he remembers sept  i knew the farther we get away from sept  the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission but not me mr bush says during the air force one interview not me i made the pledge to myself and to people that i m not going to forget what happened on sept  so long as i m president we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice we owe that to those who have lost their lives the memories come back sharp and clear on air force one where pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country  minutes ii wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack not since lyndon johnson was sworn in on air force one has the airplane been so central to america in a crisis for president bush sept   started with the usual routine before dawn the president was on his four mile run it was just before  a m and at the same moment another man was on the move mohammad atta two hours later as mr bush drove to an elementary school hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east as the motorcade neared the school at   a m jet engines echoed in manhattan atta plunged the  jumbo jet into world trade center tower one i thought it was an accident says mr bush i thought it was a pilot error i thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and and made a terrible mistake mr bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders he was watching a reading drill when just after nine united flight  exploded into the second tower there was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack back in the florida classroom press secretary ari fleischer got the news on his pager the president s chief of staff andy card stepped in a second plane hit the second tower america is under attack card told the president when he said those words what did he see in the president s face i saw him coming to recognition of what i had said card recalls i think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander in chief not just as president what was going through bush s mind when he heard the news we re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we re going to do something about it mr bush recalls i realized i was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us and i was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war i can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face and it became evident that we were you know that the world had changed mr bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone he called the vice president pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on tv then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation ladies and gentlemen this is a difficult moment for america he said in the speech today we ve had a national tragedy it was   a m as he spoke mr bush didn t know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward washington vice pesident dick cheney was in his office at the white house when a secret service agent ran in he said to me sir we have to leave immediately and grabbed put a hand on my belt another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office cheney recalls i m not sure how they do it but they sort of levitate you down the hallway you move very fast there wasn t a lot of time for chitchat you know with the vice president says secret service director brian stafford who was in his command center ordering the round up of top officials and the first family he felt that he had only minutes to work with we knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction he says cheney was rushed deep under the white house into a bunker called the presidential emergency operations center it was built for war and this was it on her way down national security advisor condoleezza rice called mr bush it was brief because i was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the west wing says rice they were hurrying me off the phone with the president and i just said he said i m coming back and we said mr president that may not be wise i remember stopping briefly to call my family my aunt and uncle in alabama and say i m fine you have to tell everybody that i m fine but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment and in the first few hours i think the thing that was on everybody s mind was how many more planes are coming the capitol was evacuated and for the first time ever the secret service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession agents swept up the  officials who stood to become president if the others were killed they wanted to move vice president cheney fearing he was in danger even in the bunker but cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe he decided to stay at the white house no matter what it s important to emphasize it s not personal you don t think of it in personal terms you ve got a professional job to do says cheney cheney was joined by transportation secretary norm mineta who remembers hearing the faa counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital says mineta someone came in and said mr vice president there s a plane  miles out then he came in and said its now  miles out we don t know where it is exactly but it s coming in low and fast it was american flight  at   a m it exploded into the pentagon the first successful attack on washington since the war of  as the pentagon burned mr bush s limousine sped toward air force one in florida at that moment united flight  the last hijacked plane was taking dead aim at washington at the white house the staff was in the west wing cafeteria watching on tv press secretary jennifer millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate i no sooner walked outside when someone from the secret service yelled women drop your heels and run drop your heels and run and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole white house just flooded out she recalls in florida as mr bush boarded air force one he was overheard telling a secret service agent be sure to get the first lady and my daughters protected at   a m air force one thundered down the runway blasting smoke and dust in a full hrust take off communications director dan bartlett was on board it was like a rocket he remembers for a good ten minutes the plane was going almost straight up at the same moment  minutes after it was hit world trade center tower two began to falter then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel concrete and human lives someone said to me look at that i remember that look at that and i looked up and i saw and i just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment recalls rice of the tv newscast she also felt something in her gut that we ve lost a lot of americans and that eventually we would get these people i felt the anger of course i felt the anger down in the bunker cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were officials feared there could be as many as  as the planes track toward washington a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down i discussed it with the president cheney recalls are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked he said yes it was my advice it was his decision says cheney that s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft says bush but it was an easy decision to make given the given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon i say easy decision it was i didn t hesitate let me put it that way i knew what had to be done the passengers on united flight  also knew what had to be done they fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a pennsylvania meadow the flight was  minutes from washington clearly the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could the pentagon perhaps the capitol perhaps the white house these people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way too says rice meanwhile tower one was weakening it had stood for an hour and  minutes at   a m it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin the image that went round the world reached the first lady in a secure location somewhere in washington i was horrified she says i thought dear god protect as many citizens as you can it was a nightmare by   a m america s largest city was devastated its military headquarters were burning air force one turned west along the gulf coast i can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the united states says president bush i didn t need any legal briefs i didn t need any consultations i knew we were at war mr bush says the first hours were frustrating he watched the horrifying pictures but the tv signal was breaking up his calls to cheney were cutting out mr bush says he pounded his desk shouting this is inexcusable get me the vice president i was trying to clear the fog of war and there is a fog of war says the president information was just flying from all directions chief of staff card brought in the reports there was word camp david had been hit a jet was thought to be targeting mr bush s ranch i remember hearing that the state department might have been hit or that the white house had a fire in it so we were hearing lots of different information says card they also feared that air force one itself was a target cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane using the code name for air force one mr bush told an aide angel is next the threat was passed to presidential pilot colonel mark tillman it was serious before that but now it is no longer is it a time to get the president home tillman says we actually have to consider everything we say everything we do could be intercepted and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while secret service agents double checked the identity of everyone on board the crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan then came a warning from air traffic control a suspect airliner was dead ahead coming out of sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with tillman remembers tillman took evasive action pulling his plane high above normal traffic they were on course for washington but by now no one thought that was a good idea except the president i wanted to come back to washington but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the secret service or the national security team to clear the way for air force one to come back says bush so air force one set course for an underground command center in nebraska back in washington the president s closest advisor karen hughes heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to mr bush and the military operator came back to me and in a voice that to me sounded very shaken said ma am i m sorry we can t reach air force one hughes recalls hughes was out of the white house during the attacks when she came back it was a place she didn t recognize there were either military or maybe secret service dressed all in black holding machine guns as as we drove up and i never expected to see something like that in in our nation s capital says hughes when she walked into the white house no one was inside i knew it was a day that you didn t want to surprise anybody and so i yelled hello and two again kind of swat team members came running running through the the hall with again guns drawn and then took me to to the location where i met the vice president on air force one col tillman had a problem he needed to hide the most visible plane in the world a  longer than the white house itself he didn t want to use his radio because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control so he called air traffic control on the telephone we actually didn t tell them our destination or what directions we were heading says tillman we we basically just talked to em and said ok fine we have no clearance at this time we are just going to fly across the united states controllers passed air force one from one sector to another warning each other to keep the route secret ok where s he going one tower radioed to another just watch him a second tower responded don t question him where s he s going just work him and watch him there s no flight plan in and we re not going to put anything in ok sir air force one ordered a fighter escort and air traffic control radioed back air force one got two f s at about your  o clock position the staff and the president and us were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows says bartlett and the president gives them a signal of salute and the pilot kind of tips his wing and fades off and backs into formation the men in the f s were shane brotherton and randy roberts from the texas air national guard their mission was so secret their commander wouldn t tell them where they were going he just said you ll know when you see it and that was my first clue i didn t have any idea what we were going up until that point says brotherton he knew when he saw it we we were trying to keep an  mile bubble bubble around air force one and we d investigate anything that was within  miles says roberts bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft or for his own safety i looked out the airplane and saw two f s on each wing it was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us we now know that the threat to air force one was part of the fog of war a false alarm but it had a powerful effect at the time some wondered with the president out of sight was he still running the government he hadn t appeared after the attack on washington mr bush was clearly worried about it at one point he was overheard saying the american people want to know where their dang president is the staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead mr bush ordered air force one to land somewhere within  minutes so he could appear on tv at   a m they landed at barksdale air force base in louisiana the resolve of our great nation is being tested but make no mistake we will show the world that we will pass this test god bless bush said to the nation from barksdale at barksdale the secret service believed the situation in washington was still unsafe so the plane continued on to nebraska to the command center where mr bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government aboard air force one mr bush had a job for press secretary fleischer the president asked me to make sure that i took down everything that was said i think he wanted to make certain that a record existed says fleischer fleischer s notes capture mr bush s language plain and unguarded to the vice president he said we re at war dick we re going to find out who did this and kick their ass another time mr bush said we re not going to have any slap on the wrist crap this time the president adds i can remember telling the secretary of defense i said we re going to find out who did this and then mr secretary you and dick myers who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs are going to go get them by  p m air force one touched down at offutt air force base in nebraska mr bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below at the bottom of the stairs was the u s strategic command underground command center it was built to transmit a president s order to go to nuclear war but when mr bush walked in the battle staff was watching the skies over the united states many airplanes had still not landed after a short briefing mr bush and card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the white house the pentagon the fbi and the cia mr bush had a question for his cia director george tenent according to rice bush asked tenent who had done this rice recalls that tenent answered sir i believe its al qaeda we re doing the assessment but it looks like it feels like it smells like al qaeda the evidence would build fbi director robert mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed a flight attendant on american flight  amy sweeney had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers that was the first piece of hard evidence we could then go to the manifest find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination says mueller in nebraska the white house staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the air force bunker but by then the president had had enough he decided to come back at one point he said he didn t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of washington fleischer says that verbatim on board he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world i had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged one was that you re guilty if you harbor a terrorist because i knew these terrorists like al qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people the other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists as air force one sped east the last casualty of the attack on america collapsed one of the nation s worst days wore into evening at the world trade center   were killed at the pentagon  and in pennsylvania  altogether there were   dead anybody who would attack america the way they did anybody who would take innocent life the way they did anybody who s so devious is evil bush said recently mr bush would soon see that evil face to face after arriving in washington he boarded his helicopter and flew past the pentagon on the way to the white house was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a white house to return to i don t remember thinking about whether or not the white house would have been obliterated he recalls i think i might have thought they took their best shot and now it was time for us to take our best shot mr bush arrived back at the white house nine hours after the attacks his next step was an address to the nation karen hughes and her staff were already working on the speech he decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance remembers hughes we had to show resolve we had to reassure people we had to let them know that we would be ok just off the oval office mr bush added the words that would become known as the bush doctrine no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them the staff wanted to add a declaration of war but mr bush didn t think the american people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that he prepared to say it from the same desk where franklin roosevelt first heard the news of pearl harbor now bush was commander in chief eighty million americans were watching today our fellow citizens our way of life our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts he said from the oval office that night the oval office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in american history since the civil war before he walked to the white house residence for the night mr bush dictated these words for the white house daily log the pearl harbor of the st century took place today we think it s osama bin laden cbs when sept  dawned president bush was demanding a war plan no one in the white house or the pentagon could be sure of what the president would do in office for just eight months he d never been tested as commander in chief i never asked them what they thought president bush said of the pentagon brass because i didn t really because i knew what i was gonna do i knew exactly what had to be done scott and that was to set a strategy to seek justice find out who did it hunt them down and bring them to justice in the cabinet room the president made clear what was next the deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror they were acts of war he said to the war cabinet al qaeda was no surprise national security advisor condoleezza rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin laden s organization well before sept  the president said you know i m tired of swatting at flies i need a strategy to eliminate these guys rice recalls in one of the worst intelligence failures ever the cia and fbi didn t pick up clues that an attack in the united states was imminent without a sense of urgency the white house strategy the president had asked for came too late chief of staff andrew card recalls that the plan mr bush had asked for was literally headed to the president s desk i think on the eleventh tenth or eleventh of september on sept  the war cabinet was debating the full range of options who to hit and how to hit them there were some at the pentagon who worried in the early hours that mr bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike of the kind that had not deterred bin laden in the past well there s a lot of nervous nellies at the pentagon anyway mr bush tells pelley a lot of people like to chatter you know more than they should but no i appreciate that very much secretary of defense donald rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called boots on the ground that if you re gonna go to war then you ve gotta go to war with all your assets the president says he wanted to fight and win a guerilla war with conventional means it was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by cia director george tenent tenent wanted to combine american technology and intelligence with the brute force of afghan fighters hostile to the taliban government secretary of state colin powell noting that the cia had already developed a long relationship with the afghan resistance called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem as i like to describe it to my friends powell says we had on the ground a fourth world army riding horses and living in tents with some cia and special forces with them and we had a first world air force the best in the world how do you connect it all the president gave them  hours to figure it out meanwhile mr bush went to the battlefield himself just the day before he had called the pentagon the mightiest building in the world now one fifth of it was in ruins the wreckage of american flight  was being examined by navy investigators and before mr bush left he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch the next day sept  there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible a large truck bomb headed to the white house the secret service wanted the president back in the bunker he wasn t real receptive to that to that recommendation remembers brian stafford director of the secret service and he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the white house that evening and that s what he did the next day would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president on friday sept  mr bush started the day with a cabinet meeting but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause he sat down slightly overcome for a moment but he recaptured it says powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning and i just scribbled a little note to him powell recalls and i said mr president i ve learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up he looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said the secretary of state told me not to break down at the memorial service and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and i felt embarrassed first lady laura bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting i wanted the psalms and everything to be read to be comforting because i think we were a country that needed everyone of us needed comforting it also stirred the mourners resolve as rice remember as we stood to sing the battle hymn of the republic she says you could feel the entire congregation and i could certainly feel myself stiffen the kind of spine and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve we all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again next came a visit to ground zero the president was not prepared for what he encountered there you couldn t brief me you couldn t brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it mr bush says it was like it was ghostly like you re having a bad dream and you re walking through the dream the president found the scene very powerful particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant usa usa there was a lot of bloodlust the president recalls people were you know pointing their big old hands at me saying don t you ever forget this mr president don t let us down the scene was very powerful very powerful when mr bush tried to speak the crowd kept shouting we can t hear you the president responded i can hear you i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon mr bush had been in new york just a few weeks before he d posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the president s helicopter landed there now five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead lost at ground zero when the president arrived sept  manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost families unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing it was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother at a meeting the public never saw the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall people said to me he ll come out don t worry mr president we ll see him soon i know my loved one he will he ll find a place to survive underneath the rubble and we ll get him out i on the other hand had been briefed about the realities and my job was to hug and cry but i remember the whole time thinking this is incredibly sad because the loved ones won t come out one little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it mr bush remembers he told the boy your daddy won t believe that i was here so you show him that autograph it was an effort to provide a little hope the president recalls i still get emotional thinking about it because we re dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom or loved their wives who loved their husbands it was a tough time you know it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional and i was emotional at times i felt i felt the same now as i did then which is sad and i still feel sad for those who grieve for their families but through my tears i see opportunity the president was supposed to be with the families for about  minutes he stayed for two and a half hours it was there he met arlene howard the body of her son george was among the first to be found at ground zero i called the police department howard remembers and they said he hadn t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and i said no i don t need to call back if he hadn t called in i knew where he was george howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in  when the world trade center was bombed he had been off duty that day and he was off duty on sept  but couldn t stay away the police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president he the president he leaned over to talk to me howard recalls and he extends his sympathy to me and that s when i asked him i d like to present george s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who were killed over there by the end of that day mr bush flew to camp david visibly drained he was physically exhausted he was mentally exhausted he was emotionally exhausted he was spiritually exhausted recalls card the next day saturday sept  mr bush met members of his war cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting my message is for everybody who wears the uniform get ready the united states will do what it takes mr bush told them as powell remembers it he was encouraging us to think boldly he was listening to all ideas he was not constrained to any one idea he wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other president bush was pleased with the progress that had been made on the other hand he says i wanted to clarify plans and i went around the room and i asked everybody what they thought ought to happen when he left that meeting on saturday night he still had not told the cabinet what he was planning i wanted to just think it through mr bush remembers any time you commit troops to harm s way a president must make sure that he fully understands all the consequences and ramifications and i wanted to just spend some time on it alone and did what were his reservations mr bush says could we win i didn t want to be putting our troops in there unless i was certain we could win and i was certain we could win nine days after the attacks on america before a joint session of congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened mr bush told the congress and the nation we ll remember the moment the news came where we were and what we were doing some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever and i will carry this it is the police shield of a man named george howard who died at the world trade center trying to save others it was given to me by his mom arlene as a proud memorial to her son it is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end a year has passed since then but the president says his job is still to remind americans of what happened and of the war that is still being waged a war he reminds himself of every day in the oval office literally keeping score one terrorist at a time in his desk the president says i have a classified document that might have some pictures on there just to keep reminding me about who s out there where they might be and as the terrorists are captures or killed i might make a little check there yeah mr bush admits but there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list osama bin laden cbs a lot has happened in the year since sept  one year ago the president was new on the job with little experience in foreign policy he had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements now on his orders u s forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect in a world completely changed in the oval office last week cbs news correspondent scott pelley asked the president about iraq about whether americans are safe at home and about osama bin laden scott pelley you must be frustrated maybe angry after a year we still don t have osama bin laden president bush how do you know that i don t know whether osama bin laden is dead or alive i don t know that he s not leading a lot of parades and he s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was this is much bigger than one person anyway this is we re slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al qaeda network that that hates america and we will stay on task until we complete the task i always knew this was a different kind of war scott see in the old days you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships this is an international manhunt we re after these people one at the time they re killers period pelley but have you won the war before you find osama bin laden dead or alive mr bush if he were dead there s somebody else to replace him and we would find that person but slowly but surely we will dismantle the al qaeda network and those who sponsor them and those who harbor them and at the same time hopefully lay the seeds for the conditions necessary so that people don t feel like they ve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives pelley do you look back on the afghan campaign with any doubts certainly we ve overthrown the taliban government certainly al qaeda has been scattered but some of the taliban leaders appear to have gotten away and there have been many civilian casualties as well mr bush uh huh well you know i am sad that civilians lost their life but i understand war we did everything we can to everything we could to protect people when civilians did die it was because of a mistake certainly not because of intention we liberated a country for which i m extremely proud no i don t second guess things it s things never go perfect in a time of war pelley are you committed to ending the rule of saddam hussein mr bush i m committed to regime change pelley there are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in iraq some of our allies in the gulf war saudi arabia turkey for example even your father s former national security advisor mr scowcroft has written about it in the paper what is it in your estimation that they don t understand about the iraq question that you do appreciate mr bush the policy of the government is regime change scott hasn t changed i get all kinds of advice i m listening to the advice i appreciate the consultations and we ll consult with a lot of people but our policy hasn t changed pelley on air force one you described the terrorists as evil mr bush yeah pelley i don t think anyone would disagree with that but at the same time many in the arab world are angry at the united states for political reasons because of our policy in israel or our troops in the oil region of the middle east is there any change in foreign policy that you re considering that might reduce arab anger against the united states mr bush hmm well i m working for peace in the middle east i m the first president that ever went to the united nations and publicly declared the need to have a palestinian state living side by side with israel in peace i ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace the palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the palestinian people as pawns i ve also made it clear to the other arab nations in the region that they ve got responsibilities if you want peace they gotta work toward it we re more than willing to work for it but they have to work for it as well but all this business isn t going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many so we all gotta work to fight off terror pelley arafat has to go mr bush either he s he s been a complete failure as far as i am concerned utter disappointment pelley there has been some concern over the year about civil liberties mr bush yeah pelley in fact an appeals court recently was harsh about your administration s decision to close certain deportation hearings they said quote a government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the constitution where do you draw the line sir mr bush i draw the line at the constitution we will protect america but we will do so on within the guidelines of the constitution confines of the constitution spirit of the constitution pelley is there anything that the justice department has brought to you as an idea that you ve thought no that s too far i don t wanna go mr bush nah not that that i remember and i am pleased with the justice department i think that attorney general s doing a fine job by the way and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make i think that s fine i mean that s good it s healthy it s part of america pelley franklin roosevelt said that america should stand in defense of four freedoms freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from want and freedom from fear do we have that today mr president freedom from fear mr bush i think more than we did in retrospect the fact that we are on alert the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of september the th we ve got more work to do pelley and americans should not live their lives in fear mr bush i don t think so no i think americans oughta know their government s doing everything possible to help and obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack we ll deal with it and if we get noise that deals with a general attack we ll alert people there are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads and the american people need to go about their lives it seems like they are ', ' guido i don t know

spam filters with this post so here s the second try kissinger s book _does america need a foreign policy _ provides a few handy abstractions the ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between values idealism and interests realism and occasionally between peace and justice also he views historical american approaches to foreign policy as a bundle of three fibers hamiltonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to preserve balances of power wilsonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to further democracy etc jacksonian we should never get involved in foreign adventures unless we re attacked then we go rambo he has tactfully left out the hard realists as for the rest i gather wilsonians play the idealists and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect and jacksonians act only when values and interests overlap kissinger himself seems to be a hamiltonian much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions maybe i ve been too affected by kant but i can t see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a bismarck runnning it how lopsided does the us look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics dave the road to empire leads to domestic decay because in time the claims of omnipotence erode domestic restraints no empire has avoided the road to caesarism unless like the british empire it devolved its power before this process could develop in long lasting empires every problem turns into a domestic issue which should be handled very differently from international ones because the outside world no longer provides a counterweight and as challenges grow more diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent a deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the values that made the united states great kings and tyrants generically have

of yorkshire s most famous sights yesterday became one of the first targets in bizarre attacks on white horse landmarks linked to the hunting debate villagers near thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday to find the famous white horse of kilburn had acquired a rider during the night in another incident the uffington white horse in oxfordshire had a huntsman and three hounds added to the ancient figure which is thought to represent a celtic god or tribal symbol pro hunt activists in the real countryside alliance rca a radical alternative to the better known countryside alliance admitted responsibility last night for targeting the two images the ft by ft landmark at kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster john hodgson and his pupils in  but during monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman with a horn which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white carpet it was removed yesterday by members of kilburn white horse association who found a countryside alliance badge attached to the carpet john roberts of the association said it has obviously been very well organised it was a well crafted piece of kit a figure of a huntsman with a horn cut out of carpets it was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about they tied it to bushes at the top and nailed it down it caused all the stone chippings to be pushed downwards which will help turn the white horse grey it will not get another refit for another year whoever did it must have come with a vehicle a tractor and trailer or a lorry because the carpet must have come in one piece it was extremely well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off the sculpture needs constant work because unlike chalk horses in the south of england it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs whitening mr roberts added the damage as such is not great but it adds to the deterioration which means it will need more work next time we would have more sympathy if having made the point they would come to take it away again because it was a major job andy wilson chief executive of the north york moors national park said it is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white there is also careful consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes there has not been a cut in the turf which would be much more of a problem it would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand an rca spokesman said some people in the country are getting very frustrated at the inaction all we want is ministers to take notice marches don t seem to be doing anything good the countryside alliance said it did not have any part in the action spokesman adrian yelland said the countryside alliance only ever advocates campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident the incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in yorkshire

monkey god by omer farooq bbc reporter in hyderabad hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a hindu god in the southern indian state of andhra pradesh the monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over zealous worshippers the animal was cremated in anantapur district  kilometres  miles south of the state capital hyderabad on sunday it had not eaten for three weeks last rites were performed by priests in the village of timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the hindu monkey god hanuman garlanded one animal rights activist said his group s efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people the monkey s death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple but were prevented by villagers the monkey which was found perched on top of an idol of hanuman a month ago attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages as well as from the neighbouring state of karnataka devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock exploited locals said they believed that lord hanuman was visiting the village as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents but animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated they filed a petition in the state s high court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple the group also alleged that people s religious feelings were being exploited to make money the court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time ', 'i think i ll ask this question again as i sent on friday afternoon justin hi can anyone

fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa our new music and news channel for   year old arabs it s  in practically every market it s entered nearing  listenership in amman and it s even beginning to be trusted for news well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term many of you may disagree but i found the document below surprisingly centrist if you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re icc taiwan relations act etc but still this is as much a democratic platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might as you read replace united states with roman empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history i don t know how proud to be about that but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our  military installations overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us heck i d love to see a real time map of federal expenditures around the globe a softly glowing necklace of embassies carriers arctic research stations hotels golf courses warehouses libraries clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy of course this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the bush doctrine for pre emptive strikes i d sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world rohit september   full text bush s national security strategy following is the full text of president bush s new national security strategy the document entitled the national security strategy of the united states will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administration s policy introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise in the twenty first century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages today the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty by making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government today that task has changed dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies and as a matter of common sense and self defense america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action as we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war today the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth in time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement finally the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world the events of september   taught us that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the united states will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases in building a balance of power that favors freedom the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent for freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations the world trade organization the organization of american states and nato as well as other long standing alliances coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions in all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission i overview of america s international strategy our nation s cause has always been larger than our nation s defense we fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent president bush west point new york june   the united states possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom for most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality that great struggle is over the militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must defeat these threats to our nation allies and friends this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty the u s national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity and this path is not america s alone it is open to all to achieve these goals the united states will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century ii champion aspirations for human dignity some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities president bush west point new york june   in pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property these demands can be met in many ways america s constitution has served us well many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us as a result america is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern europe between  and  or in belgrade in  when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies we will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends just three days removed from these events americans do not yet have the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing president bush washington d c the national cathedral september   the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents in many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and al qaida but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america south america europe africa the middle east and across asia our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks however this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction wmd or their precursors defending the united states the american people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism this includes using the full influence of the united states and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening america s homeland security to protect against and deter attack this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic while our focus is protecting america we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends wherever possible the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations as well as non governmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts we build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small president bush berlin germany may   concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states falter the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u s action direct or indirect is warranted we have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israeli palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of america s close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine living beside israel in peace and security like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict the united states the international donor community and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary if palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine permanent occupation threatens israel s identity and democracy so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible palestinian state as there is progress towards security israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september   and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them in south asia the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society the administration sees india s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by indonesia that allows u s assistance to make a difference in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly mexico brazil canada chile and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope we will work with regional institutions such as the summit of the americas process the organization of american states oas and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere parts of latin america confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country in colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people in africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united states preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror american interests and american principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity together with our european allies we must help strengthen africa s fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa nigeria kenya and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub saharan africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent v prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power president bush west point new york june   the nature of the cold war threat required the united states with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war our security environment has undergone profound transformation having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make today s security environment more complex and dangerous in the s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes these states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands at the time of the gulf war we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well these states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmd armed adversaries strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs the recent g  agreement to commit up to  billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of today s threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option we cannot let our enemies strike first in the cold war especially following the cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo risk averse adversary deterrence was an effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations in the cold war weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action for centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would fail instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september   mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies the united states cannot remain idle while dangers gather we will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions to support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough when nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively president bush monterrey mexico march   a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america s shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity the lessons of history are clear market economies not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u s national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners including through the group of seven g  to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets we will work actively with other countries the international monetary fund imf and the private sector to implement the g  action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it this is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living to promote free trade the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy seize the global initiative the new global trade negotiations we helped launch at doha in november  will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in  the united states has led the way in completing the accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade organization we will assist russia s preparations to join the wto press regional initiatives the united states and other democracies in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of the americas targeted for completion in  this year the united states will advocate market access negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement we will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the african growth and opportunity act and leading to free trade move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements building on the free trade agreement with jordan enacted in  the administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and singapore our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world initially central america southern africa morocco and australia will be our principal focal points renew the executive congressional partnership every administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with congress after a gap of  years the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the trade act of  this administration will work with congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade promotion authority promote the connection between trade and development trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the  countries of sub saharan africa we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union canada and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets protect the environment and workers the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into u s trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto and use the international labor organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the western hemisphere africa central asia and the caspian region we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate our overall objective is to reduce america s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by  percent over the next  years by the year  our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic u n framework convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for u s cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of   billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a  million increase over last year s budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy in world war ii we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens president bush washington d c inter american development bank march   a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than  a day is neither just nor stable including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of u s international policy decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy working with other nations the united states is confronting this failure we forged a new consensus at the u n conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change this administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform we propose a  percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states while continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor we have reversed the downward trend in u s contributions and proposed an  percent increase in the u s contributions to the international development association ida the world bank s fund for the poorest countries and the african development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor when it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results for this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals thanks to u s leadership the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results and part of the u s contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens as a result of u s leadership the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education hiv aids health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks we will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hiv aids organized by u n secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development only about  percent of world bank resources are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least  percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa the united states can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids continue to aid agricultural development new technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water using sound science the united states should help bring these benefits to the  million people including  million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power we have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war president bush west point new york june   america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization nato which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter european security and the european union eu our partner in opening world trade the attacks of september  were also an attack on nato as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v self defense clause for the first time nato s core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances nato must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under nato s own mandate as well as contributing to mission based coalitions to achieve this we must expand nato s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces if nato succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the same time we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come the attacks of september  energized america s asian alliances australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september  was an attack on australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack we have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand the war against terrorism has proven that america s alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and friendships we will look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term build on  years of u s australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asia pacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly russia india and china in all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the euro atlantic community and the united states russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand increasingly that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russia s entry into the world trade organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the nato russia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia our european allies and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russia s growing commitment to integration into the euro atlantic community at the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that u s interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of india s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of india s economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asia pacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy china s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asia pacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hiv aids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from china s entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over  billion in annual two way trade the power of market principles and the wto s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the self defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september   fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our long standing allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington d c joint session of congress september   the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our military s highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against u s interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold war era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the u s commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of u s forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure u s access to distant theaters and protect critical u s infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting u s intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend america s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect u s nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u s personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond america s borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins ', 'hiya i just myself an rpm and when i did uvh to upgrade the

request and the attention it requires i got your contact information from your country s information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes my name is mr michael kamah the second son of mr smith kamah of beitbridge  the height of the present political crises in our country in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president mr robert g mugabe in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the th of february  in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our  father during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr robert mugabe and his followers which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts that not being enough the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes that included my fathers assets and accounts who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers along with the assets of these white farmers themselves that are being presently confiscated i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood during my fathers life on earth he had deposited the sum of eight million and six hundred thousand united states dollars     in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful  view of this and as the only surviving son of my father and with the present clamp down killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa

instruments was economically crippling imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering ious on your own name and then trying to market exchange the paper as the merchant who took the iou the most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money the effects are a complete disaster there are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is

classifier basically ended up counting way more   than   clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly   there s a brief discussion of this before the definition of max_discriminators all clues with prob min_spamprob and max_spamprob are saved in min and max lists and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list whatever remains of the longer list if anything is then fed into the nbest heap too but no more than max_discriminators of them in no case do more than max_discriminators clues enter into the final probability calculation but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues else you d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed in your specific case the excess of clues in the longer max_spamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap and that s why you didn t see anything other than   and   before adding these special lists the outcome when faced with many   and   clues was too often a coin toss whichever flavor just happened to appear max_discriminators   times first determined the final outcome that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i just beat it wink a tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams turned up a low probability very long spam with a list of    clues and    clues yikes i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo no matter how often it says zope it gets only one   clue from doing so ditto for zeo in contrast html markup has many unique words that get   btw this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionally independent word probabilities is utterly bogus e g the probability that body appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of br appearing by treating them as independent naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink read the what about html section in  from the very start i ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at  and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context i haven t done anything geared toward personal email including the case of non mailing list email that happens to go through  i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block but as the comment block also says xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited and we ve since done several things that gave significant f n rate reductions i should test that again now are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left almost all of them apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies like content type the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject from x mailer and organization or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there i would need different data yes my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations which i may or may not be able to clean out but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i haven t changed a byte so far and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it in particular i have to skip to and received headers now and i suspect they re going to be very valuable in real life for example i don t even catch undisclosed recipients in the to header now no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora i think it s still corpus size i reported on tests i ran with random samples of  spams and  hams from my corpus that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes and while that did harm the error rates the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using  of each ah a full test run just finished on the tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code tokenize everything in the body lastw for w in word_re findall text n len w make sure this range matches in tokenize_word if  n  if w  s w w  yield w if lastw yield lastw w lastw w elif n  lastw for t in tokenize_word w yield t where word_re re compile r w x xff this at least

urgently needed food aid can be delivered says the un food agency the executive director of the world food programme james morris said zimbabwe s decision would send an important message to other countries in the region which have refused food aid because it might contain gm grain until now zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute ground maize to allay fears that gm grain could be planted but a zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco system there have been fears that southern african nations could lose lucrative export markets in europe if they cannot certify that their crops are gm free aid mr morris announced the policy reversal after talks in harare with zimbabwean president robert mugabe the fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in accepting gm crops or commodities will be an important signal to other countries in the region mr morris told journalists it will enable us to do our job he said aid workers say up to  million people in seven countries in southern africa face famine in zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the region some six million people are estimated to need food aid the wfp says it already has aid pledges for about half of the   tonnes of food it intends to bring into zimbabwe in the next few months the government blames the shortages solely on drought but the government s campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has worsened the situation say many donors lost markets the

it could not be planted have placated fears in malawi and mozambique united states aid officials deny that the food is unsafe pointing out that americans eat gm maize every day the world health

tend to be less promiscuous than males simply does not fit the facts hrdy contended well duh it is perfectly obvious that heterosexual promiscuity is exactly precisely identical between males and females of course the shapes of the distributions may differ if you assumed people on fork had a clue would you have needed to jump in with a patronizing duh if you were talking about fuzzy typical behavior would you have huffed and puffed with the words perfectly obvious and exactly precisely identical if your concern was with the typical why didn t you adopt the typical definition of promiscuous rather than a straw man definition which allowed you to interject duh and mock an anthrolopology professor s conclusions actually you probably just had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it you are welcome to that theory but here s an alternate theory when you jump in with a patronizing and overblown pronouncement e g duh perfectly obvious exactly precisely

panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and a waste of real estate form auto fill is not useful for me unless i can fill out  pages of personal information first should just happen

them yourself i expect phoenix will have a little add in manager that will facilitate this process there is currently an expectation on the part of an alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should automatically be part of the default mozilla install download why a layered approach scales better you can then have a browser that can become as complex as you want to make it but the choice is left in your hands the geek features aren t inflicted on you by default finally remember that phoenix s ui is not controlled by netscape this is an opportunity for some of

clothes up and tidied the room i thought it was marvelous he said i knew then there was something special moylan  is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet and marry thai women he lives in england now with  year old wan who is expecting their first child critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries offering dreams of a new life in the west that often turn sour but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand in search of a wife i got to thailand at  p m and by  p m i d met wan he said i knew i found her attractive i could tell straight away that she was very caring moylan spent a week in thailand and after returning to england kept in touch with wan by phone and mail six months later she came to

after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction agency since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages in the last five years we ve done about  he said to the best of my knowledge they have all been successful male clients pay   for the service although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women looking for a husband if they like what they see they come to bangkok clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynch s office encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies lynch said but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax after the first meeting couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better within two weeks of arrival lynch says almost every client has found a potential wife at the end of a fortnight it s very very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn t made his mind up he said in most cases marriage follows usually within the next year roongthip kamchat managing director of thai

are really in a hurry roongthip says she can find them a wife and get them married within a week lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man a man with one leg and a man with post traumatic stress disorder why similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy there is no reason to object if you talk about people who are needy i think everybody wants someone to love them and wants someone to love so yes i need wan he said thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand i think there s no secret there they are looking for a better life i don t have a problem with that in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband lynch says men are

she said many thai girls are slim have long hair black eyes small nose they are good at taking care and joking and laughing not strict different from ladies from other countries although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap the agencies say this is not a problem they say language problems are also not a major obstacle thai ladies are not ageist and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older lynch said when i met my wife she couldn t speak a word of english we muddled along with a phonetic dictionary the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up very quickly many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the west we have kitchens we have study classes roongthip said we teach

weeded out we are ethical and professional he said we will not take on all comers moylan says that despite possible pitfalls his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work wan s sister has just

servlets database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is e commerce but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption decryption the api that i m using is the jca jdk  x and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object and store in the database but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesn t really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list something i thought that can be of bit interest but probabily wrong and insecure after all i m a real beginner in secure programming and i m here to learn methods and technics first of all i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat so it is not shared with other web services or worst the nobody user that has no shell login but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signature rmi whatever else that the source is the right one and handle all the database connections or give the db connection password to the main web application in this way we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories and also an attacker should get root bean user account to read data this is not perfect and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means really another server running in the background any suggestions

geodesic economy robert a hettinga sunday august   boston when you think about it one way the fbi winter hill vs patriarcha angiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs put crudely and at its most racist the fbi and the winter hill gang were the mostly irish thugs and patriarcha s family were of course the mostly italian thugs think scorsese s upcoming gangs of new york only with counter reformatory overtones hoover s south boston social club putsch starting in the mid  s was particularly audacious in hindsight the u s federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition era capture of the nation s rackets by the italians from the irish the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york but for south boston the most irish place in the us only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all the result as we all found out wasn t swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone hoover was posthumously swapping it for oxycontin or crystal methamphetamine or more properly pcp the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulger s crack cocaine era reign of boston s drug markets like the identical fbi sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also rans in cities across the us as a whole went up whole orders of magnitude not mere percentage points as stalin said once quantity has a quality all it s own and make no mistake j edgar hoover was directly responsible that quality of carnage nation wide so yes on paper at least it really was just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another and the result was on paper at least business as usual same stuff different century with apparently decent people like mr salvati  accidently ground on the gears of justice like so much hamburger however to be much more macabre about it that hamburger was greasing if you will an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love a perfectly functioning market legislated out of existence on paper if nowhere else by government fiat and the back door but still elitist will to power of h l mencken s famous bluenoses and busybodies it all starts like all true evil does from the most innocent of beginnings what she couldn t do to alcohol teatotaling mrs grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller manageable demand the bloody result was like nine more heads of the hydra an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition in more markets and for more things as the th century wore on every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive or harmful or physically distasteful or carcinogenic or now apparently fattening and then prohibited exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years a larger market than before the prohibition hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly legislated barriers to competition imposed on them by the state increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances and finally the ultimate in evil the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end increasingly coercive axe handle beatings by our own government of the sacred liberty of the average but now unavoidably law breaking citizenry as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago you don t need government if nobody s breaking the law in some twisted corollary to parkinson s law governments to survive need more people breaking more laws or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time and to bring us back to the point david friedman would probably echo here his father milton s famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market and never the consumer much less the economy as a whole even especially if those sellers are breaking the law as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us and there absent the apparent grace of mr hoover went mr salvati in fact hayek himself in the road to serfdom couldn t have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoover s blatant imposition for our own good of vietnam era statist power at the neighborhood level and furthermore stalin couldn t have had better useful idiots than hoover did and neither by an absolutely literal extension did whitey bulger after hoover useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle idiots who were eating out of hoover s power craven hand for the entire middle of the th century and whitey bulger s hand whether they knew it or not until the end of the millennium a time you ll notice which saw the increasingly steady imposition of mob violence and market control from both state and illegal interests way beyond the imaginings of even the most power mad rum running stock kiting movie flopping bureau pumping nazi appeasing irish bostonian little caesar or as for that matter his safely trust funded and now strictly political descendents in terms of actual financial economics think of what happened to mr salvati and the others dead or alive as a transfer price in human lives of the inevitable consequence of macnamara style vietnam era keynesian social cost input output accounting at its most despicable and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover and his co religionists in state economic control in the name of what really was as you ll now agree just a race war between thugs up in boston this shouldn t be a surprise really all race wars are at least fought by thugs though they re usually conceived elsewhere and endorsed at the time by all the right people for all the right reasons as far as the fbi itself goes remember mancur olson s observation that a prince is just a stationary bandit though given his penchant for women s clothing for other men and what s actually obscene for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference i suppose we can call j edgar hoover a bandit princess instead bandit queen of course would be a grievous insult to queens and real bandits everywhere cheers rah  pagewanted print position top the new york times august   hoover s f b i and the mafia case of bad bedfellows grows by fox butterfield boston aug  it was march  in the early days of j edgar hoover s war against the mafia f b i agents say congressional investigators eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of new england s organized crime boss raymond patriarca two gangsters joseph barboza and vincent flemmi wanted mr patriarca s permission to kill a small time hoodlum edward deegan as they were having a problem with him according to an f b i log of the conversation patriarca ultimately furnished this o k the f b i reported and three days later mr deegan turned up dead in an alley shot six times it was an extraordinary situation the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved but when indictments in the case were handed down in  the real killers who also happened to be informers for the f b i were left alone four other men were tried convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder though they had had nothing to do with it one joseph salvati who spent  years in prison filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the f b i for  million for false imprisonment his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the f b i the justice department and some f b i agents growing out of the tangled corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the f b i s boston office in its effort to bring down the mob the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light including documents detailing conversation in which mr patriarca approved the murder they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform which has pressured the department into turning over records about the f b i in boston the documents show that officials at f b i headquarters apparently including mr hoover knew as long ago as  that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution j edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself said vincent garo mr salvati s lawyer he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants mr barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr salvati and may have implicated him because mr salvati owed  to a loan shark who worked for mr barboza asked about the documents showing that mr hoover knew of mr salvati s innocence when he was put on trial gail marcinkiewicz a spokeswoman for the f b i in boston declined to comment citing the pending litigation a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office in one of the first results of the investigation one retired agent john j connolly is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were f b i informers james bulger and stephen flemmi vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers the government reform committee led by representative dan burton republican of indiana has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureau s knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr barboza were involved in killing mr deegan a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime including who fired the first shot then on june   mr hoover s office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer in a reply five days later the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr patriarca potentially could be an excellent informant the agent also informed mr hoover that mr flemmi was known to have killed seven men and from all indications he is going to continue to commit murder nevertheless the agent said the informant s potential outweighs the risk involved a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmi s murders the director does not even respond the investigator said there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia which he had largely ignored in boston f b i agents recruited mr barboza and mr flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization the winter hill gang led by mr bulger both sides got what they wanted according to the investigations and the trial of mr connolly the f b i got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families which controlled organized crime in new england mr bulger s gang was able to take over the rackets in boston sell drugs and even commit murder while the f b i looked the other way one reason the f b i may not have used its information about mr patriarca s involvement in the deegan murder congressional investigators say is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence r i headquarters the f b i agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants to disguise the use of the device the investigators say mr salvati a former truck driver now  had his sentence commuted in  by gov william f weld last year while he was still on parole his murder conviction was dismissed by a massachusetts state judge after the justice department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison their survivors have joined the fourth man peter limone in a  million lawsuit against the justice department mr limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair his life was spared only when massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in  mr salvati lives in a modest apartment in boston s north end with his wife marie who visited him in prison every week during those  years each week mr salvati sent her a romantic card which she put on the television set it was mr garo said all they had of each other begin pgp signature version pgp   iqa

hpux and sco sun s hardware in general is more reliable and a lot more expensive one of the main bonuses you get by buying sun is that you are getting your hardware and software from one company so if you have a support contract they have to fix it they can t fob you off with that s a software problem talk to the software vendor etc if you are set on linux you most likely can do your own support there is then a world of different hardware options you can run linux on sparc though some companies like redhat don t maintain a sparc port anymore you can also buy your machine from linux oriented companies like dnuk who do machines designed to run linux and their own version of linux that has a few extras for their machines or you can get a machine from a cheaper company like dell and it ll

of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list  could this basic concept be used to easily make self fixing client server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production client server systems are layered for example your basic web application might have a web server running apache connected to an application server running some jee or net business logic connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for say swap space but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system they will probably change an image that shouldn t be changed e g they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal because it is only deleting data rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this base redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid allowing for greater performance reliability and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don t yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardware separation of volatile and non volatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting

downgraded some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies for both these categories of packages the upgrade through apt rhn whatever just won t do as some older

modify time cache trick for files in many places not just exmh so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective however it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state then aren t we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view as i d written the code a few months ago we were reading the sequences file first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence this happens anywhere that we look at sequences most notably in ftoc_showsequences that seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise but i wanted my abstraction to have a separate call for what sequences are in this folder and what messages are in this sequence one option would have been to add another call to get the data off of disk but i felt that the check the modify time technique would be less error prone i like the check the modify time technique i think the biggest gains would be from augmenting ftoc_showsequences to allow a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences for all messages i described these thoughts in an email message yesterday and again if it can wait a few weeks i m willing to do it ok i ve yet to dive into the latest round of changes but i plan to i can say i ll make

it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward this is a legitimate business you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in

the  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are  primary methods to get this venture going method  by sending bulk e mail legally let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only   e mails each let s also assume that the mailing receives only a     of  response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only   also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only   each continuing with this example you send out only   e mails with a   response that is only  orders for report  those  people responded by sending out   e mails each for a total of   out of those   e mails only   responded with orders that s  people who responded and ordered report  those  people mail out   e mails each for a total of   e mails the   response to that is  orders for report  those  people send   e mails each for a total of  million e mails sent out the   response is   orders for report  those   people send out   e mails each for a total of     million e mails the   response to that is   orders for report  that s   orders times  each    half a million dollars your total income in this example is              grand total    numbers do not lie get a pencil paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money remember friend this is assuming only  people ordering out of   you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one th of those people mailed   e mails each or more there are over  million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day believe me many people will do just that and more method  by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method  and add method  as you go along for every  you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report available reports the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only notes always send  cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least  sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name and postal address place your order for these reports now report  the insider s guide to advertising

got your contact through the internet and decided to contact you for assistance i was until recently a final year engineering student of the university of sierra leone west africa early in january last year the rebels in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks my late father king christopher george being the king of the town was a prime target fortunately for me i was in school when the attack took place i equally lost my only sister to the rebels when i got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed i discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some m united states dollars six million united states dollars with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d ivorie this money according to the docement was meant for the building of an auto repair company for me by my late father when i complete my studies upon the discovery of this document i travelled to the cote d ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next of kin to my father but deliberatley i have decided to keep all my uncles and aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know i am in possession of such money i have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that i am the next of kin and all the documents related to are now with me i do not know what to do with it but i have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a time that i will be ready to begin to use it i am really desperate as i am left alone now in the world let me know what you want as compensation for helping me to solve this my problem most importantly iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of

contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way sa could also be configured so that swe marks are ignored in messages that look like third party spam like stock scams of

have ivy league educations or are ivy league dropouts suggesting to me that they weren t exactly poor to start with actually if i remember correctly from discussion of the list s composition in forbes about five or six years ago the best way to get on the forbes  is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps boys and girls i knew you could sure discussion in forbes rigorous research that especially when the data in their own list contradicts them i continue to look at the list and all the inherited growed entries i guess if i read it enough times my vision will clear given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school like say mine is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government run high school you ll probably get more of those on the forbes  as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government collapsing transfer payment depression an economic version of this summer s government forest conflagration caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear cutting enough forests did out west this summer that should motivate more than a few erst slackers out there including me to learn to actually feed themselves the next category on the forbes  list is someone with a terminal professional degree like an mba phd md etc from the best school possible why because as of about  the best way to get into harvard for instance is to be smart not rich don t take my word for it ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the years for proof i at on point looked into stanford business school after learning that tuition was k no financial aid was available and part time work was disallowed this smart person decided that i was not willing to spend the  application fee non refundable during attendance at my local business school i was told repeatedly i should have gone for it to quote a prof northwestern mba it has nothing to do with the education you receive in general european and canadian business schools are better and more innovative its the connections he used the words american nobility meritocracy american style was invented at the ivy league after world war ii even stanford got the hint and of course chicago taught them all how right practically nobody who goes to a top  american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless of course their parents who couldn t afford to go there themselves got terminal degrees in the last  years or so and their kids still had to get the grades and biased by intelligence test scores to get in invented being the right word dubya went to yale and hbs i guess practically gets you around that problem the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees until they actually own something and hire people or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis persist in the practically insane belief like life after death that economics is some kind of zero sum game that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money and if someone is smart works hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow btw none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were apparently too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degree in anything actually useful much less a terminal one which means i m broker than anyone on this list it s just that you of all people lots with educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and economics is not a zero sum game the cost of anything including ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case intelligence and effort i will however admit to being educated waay past my level of competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you apparently its interesting but in this part of the world nova scotia a recent study found that college graduates earn less than graduates of  year community colleges trade schools they did decline to mention that the demand for some trades is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in just for the record the average salary for a university graduate including advanced degree holders here is c     us no wonder half of san francisco has set up here we have a whole whack of call centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years i think they hire some entry level it people for around   us an hour which of course fits perfectly for me my entry level job in  paid   an hour the fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are unionized in other words in this part of the world for the vast majority of people union dues are a better investment than tuition the counter argument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere but the counter counter argument is that we are the thin edge one of several really prison labor in the us would be another of third world wages and work practices coming to north america i worked at a company that had a  year wage freeze the fact that they could maintain that and prosper just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world i met many people there like me who felt that was fine i can vote with my feet they didn t quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar or worse policies anyway eventually they started a union drive during the vote retired employees were brought in by the employer rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here a bottle of rum and somehow allowed to vote the union filed a grievance which was denied by a minister of labour who hey guess what used to be a vp at the company that s free labor markets at work the business continues to prosper as i was told when i was there it is a cash cow as long as the joa joint operating agreement with the competing paper is in place and if you think that any of those wonderful american companies out of some free enterprise belief in competing for the best talent are going to do anything about that sorry most of them received generous subsidies in return i m sure for an understanding about the labor markets here btw if we ever actually had free markets in this country including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes all those smart people in the forbes  would have more money and there would be more self made people on that list in addition most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it not even relatively speaking finally practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress for those of you in the people s republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff cheaper over time a terrible petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or you d know about it by now in economic terms it s also called an increase in general welfare and no virginia i m not talking about extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time much as i like to accept what you say i do believe in free markets i have difficulty finding any except of course for labor markets which governments go to great lengths to protect well unless the supply is tight it was a great run with the technology industry producing most of the self made billionaires on the list but now we ve got a government sponsored monopoly and the concept of more stuff cheaper which it has always promised seems to be disappearing a particularly galling example is high speed internet access an article i read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricing approaches of the it industry cheaper better or you die and the telecom industry maintain your monopoly through regulation and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators meet sadly to say the telecom industry seems to have won the whole entertainment industry riaa palladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few in short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not theft the rich don t get rich off the backs of the poor and redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit happy or otherwise to believe otherwise is quite literally given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto romantic nonsense i usually agree but when there s a republican in office i feel like they re the biggest believers in the manifesto in reverse create a reserve pool of labor reduce the rights of that proletariat you ve just created with bogus law and order policies concentrate capital in the hands of a few ideally people who can get you reelected and the economy will take care of itself oh and lie use the word compassionate a lot i guess i tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state the basic economic tenet of the republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass the more efficient the rest of us will be and the facts are for most people in the western world are declining standards of living declining benefits disappearing social safety net greater working hours essentially since the entrance of women into the work force not blaming women in any way they have a right to work but its now  wage earners in each family and still declining standards of living is the reality again to quote that wonderfully liberal document i keep coming back to the cia world factbook on the us economy since  practically
