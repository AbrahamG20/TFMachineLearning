pm subject how about subsidizing ssl access to google a cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows along with the article i was commenting on rohit in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week the search goes on sept th the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of google s service is not its card catalog which merely points surfers in the right direction but the entire library by maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web if you can get to google s cache you can read anything you d like the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce these rules however all depend on the fact that traffic to and from google or indeed almost all public websites is unencrypted almost all web browsers however include support for secure sockets layer ssl encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like upgrading to ssl makes it effectively impossible for a man in the middle to meddle censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in china the only choice left is to either ban the entire site range of ip addresses but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article of course the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money if the united states is so concerned about the free flow of information why shouldn t the broadcasting board of governors sponsor an encrypted interface to google or for that matter the rest of the web to date public diplomacy efforts have focused on public sector programming for the voice of america radio sawa and the like just imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private sector media instead nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself and most of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project on second thought i can hardly imagine this administration promoting the

the nickname for google an american internet search engine is gougou meaning doggy for the country s fast growing population of internet users m according to an official estimate it is proving an

forbidden sites now after an outcry from those users access has been restored an unusual climbdown by china s zealous internet censors hardly more sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by google as it trawls the internet these

undesirable content for example earlier this week when using eastnet a beijing based internet provider a search on google for falun gong a quasi buddhist exercise sect outlawed in china usually

with birmingham or sick of sheffield those  per cent of britons according to a daily telegraph yougov survey this week who dream of a stress free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad kommersant a russian daily newspaper yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in blair s britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial russia after reading about the gripes of affluent britons its tongue in cheek article admitted however that the grass was not always greener on the other side the inhabitants of foggy albion keen to travel could go to any russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet said kommersant in any central russian district life by british standards is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back by am most of the working population are becoming traditionally relaxed the time for elevenses in britain perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate hobnob is known in russia as the wolf hour it was so named in soviet times because at am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the obrasov puppet theatre in moscow it is also opening time in the nation s vodka shops and the vodka like all other spirits is cheap kommersant pointed out that the money a briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life the local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks there are  kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling the whisky is cheap however because it is unlike anything the average briton will have consumed before it is made of samagon home distilled moonshine vodka coloured with tea and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics while alcohol is plentiful and cheap food may not be so easy to come by the newspaper pointed out that traditional british foodstuffs it selected oxtail soup as an example were in short supply however the wealth of the british settler should overcome the difficulty for a modest reward in most russian villages the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm s herd of cattle one or two potential emigrÃ©s might be deterred by language difficulties there are few english speakers to be found among the green hills of tula on the mongolian border however kommersant pointed out language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the  per cent of britons who nominated france as the country in which they would like to live france the russian paper claimed was a country where english is only known by the beggars belorussian prostitutes and russian tourists despite the low cost of living and the easy going lifestyle the russian weather remains a major stumbling block for britons even in the most temperate regions winter temperatures of c are common and somewhere like the sakha republic east of siberia and the coldest place in the world enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below c houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible again the russian paper had a word of reassurance while acknowledging the climatic problems it said that thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in britain if  per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in russia thirty three million russians could be sent to britain to replace the  million who leave we think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens unfortunately for those  million russians however not one of those britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the russian steppes as their preferred new home yahoo groups sponsor  dvds free s p join now  to unsubscribe from this

intellectual property is and ought to be more limited than real property private money paid for these bits but expropriation may be fairer for ip than real p rohit khare  vast detail on towers collapse may be sealed september   by james glanz and eric lipton what is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the world trade center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in lower manhattan amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nation s most respected engineering minds it includes computer calculations that have produced a series of three dimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses an immense body of documentary evidence like maps of the debris piles rare photos and videos has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings but everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved may remain buried in sealed files or even destroyed bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation and as it now stands the judge in the case who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being has approved standard legal arrangements that should the lawsuit be settled before trial could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld we re obviously in favor of releasing the information but we can t until we re told what to do said matthys levy an engineer and founding partner at weidlinger associates who is a consultant in the case and the author of why buildings fall down how structures fail norton nd edition  let s just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process of the collapse mr levy said monica gabrielle who lost her husband richard when the south tower fell and who is a member of the skyscraper safety campaign said the information should be disclosed if they have answers and are not going to share them i would be devastated mrs gabrielle said they have a moral obligation the lawsuit that has generated the information involves larry a silverstein whose companies own a lease on the trade center property and a consortium of insurance companies mr silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack entitling him to some  billion rather than half that amount as the insurance companies say as both sides have prepared their arguments they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers dean davison a spokesman for industrial risk insurers of hartford one of the insurance companies in the suit said of the findings there are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today he conceded that differing opinions among the more than  insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material as for his own company whose consultants alone have produced more than   pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs mr davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to public authorities and investigative teams still some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources like the port authority of new york and new jersey which built and owned the trade center and supports mr silverstein in the suit mr davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his company s ability to release information in a statement the port authority said access to documents would be decided on a case by case basis consistent with applicable law and policy adding that it would cooperate with federal investigations the fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings collapse that investigation led by the federal emergency management agency was plagued by few resources a lack of access to crucial information like building plans and infighting among experts and officials a new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the national institute of standards and technology or nist an agency that has studied many building disasters officials with nist have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit gerald mckelvey a spokesman for mr silverstein said of the real estate executive s own heavily financed investigative work we decline to comment other than to say that silverstein is cooperating fully with the nist investigation a spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with mr silverstein on the material but said no transfer had taken place with no shortage of money or expertise investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well the work should be available to other investigators said ramon gilsanz a structural engineer and managing partner at gilsanz murray steficek who was a member of the earlier inquiry it could be used to build better buildings in the future legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information in some cases litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves or they may ask to have them sealed forever it is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another some legitimate some not said lee levine a first amendment lawyer at levine sullivan koch in washington mr levine said that because of the presumed value of the information the court might look favorably on requests to make it public but the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center it s important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny said dr john osteraas director of civil engineering practice at exponent failure analysis in menlo park calif and a consultant on the case because then the general engineering community can sort it out the scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure mr levy and his colleagues at weidlinger associates hired by silverstein properties have called upon powerful computer programs originally developed with the pentagon for classified research to create a model of the sept  attack from beginning to end the result is a compilation of three dimensional images of the severed exterior columns smashed floor and damaged core of the towers beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse those images which mr levy is not allowed to release have helped pinpoint the structural failures the fema investigators did not have access to such computer modeling nor did the fema team have unfettered access to the trade center site with all its evidence in the weeks immediately after the attacks but no such constraints hampered engineers at lza thornton tomasetti brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of sept  daniel a cuoco the company president and a consultant to silverstein properties on the case said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell though the fema team could not determine where things actually fell mr cuoco said we ve indicated the specific locations mr cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings nor would mr osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers mr osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators and the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence for months experiments in wind tunnels in the united states and canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures jack cermak president of cermak peterka peterson in fort collins colo was retained by the insurance companies but had previously performed wind tunnel studies for the original design of the twin towers nearly  years ago for the legal case dr cermak said we ve done probably more detailed measurements than in the original design the data that have been acquired are very valuable in themselves for understanding how wind and buildings interact dr cermak said some of the information may be valuable for the litigation he said adding i think i

khare alumni caltech edu to fork spamassassin taint org sent friday september     pm subject sed s united states roman empire g a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than  a day is neither just nor stable absolutely correct perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa our new music and news channel for   year old arabs it s  in practically every market it s entered nearing  listenership in amman and it s even beginning to be trusted for news well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term many of you may disagree but i found the document below surprisingly centrist if you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re icc taiwan relations act etc but still this is as much a democratic platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might as you read replace united states with roman empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history i don t know how proud to be about that but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our  military installations overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us heck i d love to see a real time map of federal expenditures around the globe a softly glowing necklace of embassies carriers arctic research stations hotels golf courses warehouses libraries clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy of course this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the bush doctrine for pre emptive strikes i d sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world rohit september   full text bush s national security strategy following is the full text of president bush s new national security strategy the document entitled the national security strategy of the united states will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administration s policy introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise in the twenty first century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages today the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty by making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government today that task has changed dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies and as a matter of common sense and self defense america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action as we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war today the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth in time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement finally the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world the events of september   taught us that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the united states will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases in building a balance of power that favors freedom the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent for freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations the world trade organization the organization of american states and nato as well as other long standing alliances coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions in all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission i overview of america s international strategy our nation s cause has always been larger than our nation s defense we fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent president bush west point new york june   the united states possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom for most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality that great struggle is over the militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must defeat these threats to our nation allies and friends this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty the u s national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity and this path is not america s alone it is open to all to achieve these goals the united states will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century ii champion aspirations for human dignity some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities president bush west point new york june   in pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property these demands can be met in many ways america s constitution has served us well many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us as a result america is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern europe between  and  or in belgrade in  when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies we will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends just three days removed from these events americans do not yet have the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing president bush washington d c the national cathedral september   the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents in many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and al qaida but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america south america europe africa the middle east and across asia our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks however this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction wmd or their precursors defending the united states the american people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism this includes using the full influence of the united states and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening america s homeland security to protect against and deter attack this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic while our focus is protecting america we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends wherever possible the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations as well as non governmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts we build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small president bush berlin germany may   concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states falter the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u s action direct or indirect is warranted we have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israeli palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of america s close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine living beside israel in peace and security like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict the united states the international donor community and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary if palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine permanent occupation threatens israel s identity and democracy so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible palestinian state as there is progress towards security israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september   and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them in south asia the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society the administration sees india s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by indonesia that allows u s assistance to make a difference in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly mexico brazil canada chile and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope we will work with regional institutions such as the summit of the americas process the organization of american states oas and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere parts of latin america confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country in colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people in africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united states preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror american interests and american principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity together with our european allies we must help strengthen africa s fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa nigeria kenya and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub saharan africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent v prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power president bush west point new york june   the nature of the cold war threat required the united states with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war our security environment has undergone profound transformation having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make today s security environment more complex and dangerous in the s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes these states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands at the time of the gulf war we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well these states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmd armed adversaries strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs the recent g  agreement to commit up to  billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of today s threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option we cannot let our enemies strike first in the cold war especially following the cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo risk averse adversary deterrence was an effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations in the cold war weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action for centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would fail instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september   mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies the united states cannot remain idle while dangers gather we will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions to support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough when nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively president bush monterrey mexico march   a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america s shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity the lessons of history are clear market economies not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u s national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners including through the group of seven g  to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets we will work actively with other countries the international monetary fund imf and the private sector to implement the g  action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it this is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living to promote free trade the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy seize the global initiative the new global trade negotiations we helped launch at doha in november  will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in  the united states has led the way in completing the accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade organization we will assist russia s preparations to join the wto press regional initiatives the united states and other democracies in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of the americas targeted for completion in  this year the united states will advocate market access negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement we will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the african growth and opportunity act and leading to free trade move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements building on the free trade agreement with jordan enacted in  the administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and singapore our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world initially central america southern africa morocco and australia will be our principal focal points renew the executive congressional partnership every administration s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with congress after a gap of  years the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the trade act of  this administration will work with congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade promotion authority promote the connection between trade and development trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the  countries of sub saharan africa we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union canada and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets protect the environment and workers the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into u s trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto and use the international labor organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the western hemisphere africa central asia and the caspian region we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate our overall objective is to reduce america s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by  percent over the next  years by the year  our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic u n framework convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for u s cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of   billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a  million increase over last year s budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy in world war ii we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens president bush washington d c inter american development bank march   a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than  a day is neither just nor stable including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of u s international policy decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy working with other nations the united states is confronting this failure we forged a new consensus at the u n conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change this administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform we propose a  percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states while continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor we have reversed the downward trend in u s contributions and proposed an  percent increase in the u s contributions to the international development association ida the world bank s fund for the poorest countries and the african development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor when it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results for this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals thanks to u s leadership the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results and part of the u s contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens as a result of u s leadership the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education hiv aids health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks we will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hiv aids organized by u n secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development only about  percent of world bank resources are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least  percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa the united states can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids continue to aid agricultural development new technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water using sound science the united states should help bring these benefits to the  million people including  million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power we have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war president bush west point new york june   america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization nato which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter european security and the european union eu our partner in opening world trade the attacks of september  were also an attack on nato as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v self defense clause for the first time nato s core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances nato must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under nato s own mandate as well as contributing to mission based coalitions to achieve this we must expand nato s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces if nato succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the same time we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come the attacks of september  energized america s asian alliances australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september  was an attack on australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack we have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand the war against terrorism has proven that america s alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and friendships we will look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term build on  years of u s australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asia pacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly russia india and china in all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the euro atlantic community and the united states russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand increasingly that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russia s entry into the world trade organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the nato russia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia our european allies and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russia s growing commitment to integration into the euro atlantic community at the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that u s interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of india s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of india s economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asia pacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy china s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asia pacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hiv aids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from china s entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over  billion in annual two way trade the power of market principles and the wto s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the self defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september   fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our long standing allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington d c joint session of congress september   the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our military s highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against u s interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold war era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the u s commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of u s forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure u s access to distant theaters and protect critical u s infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting u s intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend america s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect u s nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u s personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond america s borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins ', 'on thu sep   at   pm  mike burger wrote you might be better

ground zero by larry silverstein earlier this month we new yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on sept   all of those who perished must never be forgotten the footprints of the fallen twin towers and a portion of the  acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims families and indeed for all of us but for the good of the city and the region the  million plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the twin towers must be replaced on the site about   people worked in the world trade center those jobs are lost along with those of another   people who worked in the vicinity together those jobs in lower manhattan for which the trade center was the economic stimulus produced annual gross wages of about  billion or  of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region but many have not new york city is facing a budget deficit without additional jobs the deficit may become permanent this is one reason for the importance of rebuilding if we do not replace the lost space lower manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world s financial center love them or hate them and there were lots of new yorkers on both sides of the issue the towers made a powerful statement to the world that said this is new york a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life that is why they were destroyed this is a second reason why the towers must be replaced and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement in recent weeks redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources most of these focus not on the trade center site however but on all of lower manhattan further many believe that the  million square feet either could be located elsewhere scattered in several sites or simply never rebuilt these proposals miss the point what was destroyed and what must be recovered was the trade center not all of lower manhattan except over the towers footprints where there must be no commercial development the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size that was a major reason why the twin towers were leased to  occupancy before   none of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access with the reconstruction of the subway and path stations plus an additional   billion in transit improvements planned such as the new fulton transit center and the direct train to the plane long island rail road connection the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development and new york will need the space before   the group of  a task force of civic leaders led by sen charles schumer and former treasury secretary robert rubin concluded that the city would need an additional  million square feet of new office space by  to accommodate the anticipated addition of   new jobs the loss of the twin towers only heightens the need as for those who say that  million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market i would simply point out that history shows them wrong new york now has about  million square feet of office space all new construction underway already is substantially leased up new york had  million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in  by  this space had been absorbed at an annual rate of about  million square feet we are seeking to rebuild  million square feet on the trade center site over a period of about  years with the first buildings not coming on line until  and the project reaching completion in  this is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet much lower than the s rate those who argue that new york cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline i will not accept this view nor will most new yorkers mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york times that the city has to do two things memorialize but also build for the future i believe that the twin towers site can gracefully accommodate and that downtown requires office and retail space of architectural significance a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area the challenge to accomplish this is enormous but our city is up to the task mr silverstein is president of silverstein properties a real estate

wednesday september     pm to ben mord cc webappsec securityfocus com secprog securityfocus subject re use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks ben mord wrote i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware use vmware s ability to rolll back state to recover from intrusions i did my dissertation work in this area optimistic computing  and so was interested in applying it to the security problem unfortunately you hit a bunch of problems when can you commit a state as being good you can t run from a redo log forever the performance and storage penalties accumulate even log structured file systems garbage collect eventually so you have to commit sometime the problem is that if you commit too eagerly you might commit corrupted state if you commit too conservatively you eat performance and storage penalties what do you do if you discover that there is corrupted state in the middle of your redo log and you want some of the critical state that comes after it you need some way to dig the corruption out of the middle and save the rest my dissertation solves this problem but you have to re write everything in my programming language just doing this at all imposes substantial performance penalties i love vmware and use it every day the best  i ever spent on software but it is not very fast my proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be less ambitious the idea is that you never commit instead you simply revert to base state on reboot ah in that case you can use something considerably less powerful than vmware all you need is a machine configured to boot from cd rom and use a ram disk for scratch space numerous linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from cd rom obviously you can t do this with partitions that accrue important state e g a partition that stores database table data but if you do want some state to persist then you need a mountable writable partition to protect it you need some kind of access control management to decide who can do what to the writable partition blah blah blah and before you know it the security problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers simple approxmation to this make usr a separate partion and mount it read only the good news attackers that want to trojan your software have to reboot at least the bad

requires i got your contact information from your country s information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes my name is mr michael kamah the second son of mr smith kamah of beitbridge  the height of the present political crises in our country in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president mr robert g mugabe in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the th of february  in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our  father during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries he publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by mr robert mugabe and his followers which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts that not being enough the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes that included my fathers assets and accounts who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers along with the assets of these white farmers themselves that are being presently confiscated i therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the republic of south africa where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood during my fathers life on earth he had deposited the sum of eight million and six hundred thousand united states dollars     in a trunk box with a finance and security company in the republic of togo for a cash and carry diamond and gold business with some foreign business customers awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful  view of this and as the only surviving son of my father and with the present clamp down killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country i therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of africa finally to the europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present mugabe s  mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit now this is what i actually want you to do for me  i want you to be presented to the finance and security company as the person i contacted to assist my family for this purpose with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the republic of togo as the person that will clear this money when

boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket second never trust an investment adviser of any kind they are looking out for their own money not yours the professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is now according to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money you re going to make ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is never in a sense they are right if you put   in an index fund right now you ll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years but here s the problem do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich hell no you want the money now so you can enjoy it it s hard to make use of your fortune when you re seventy years old in a wheelchair if you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it where would you travel what kind of car would you buy the fact is youth is the best time to be rich if your goal is to make quick profits in the market volatility is your ally and stability your enemy you want to see those large upswings two hundred points in a day followed by the four hundred point crash a week later you don t care if the market went up or down  this year as long it was unstable that s how you re going to make the money what i m talking about here is day trading my father invests the traditional way he holds some good stocks and he goes up k and down k in the long term of   years he makes money the day trader buys or sells   shares of xyz for a   profit in a   minute trade he acts quickly taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours sometimes within minutes i can teach you how to do this and how to make amazing amounts of money at it it s not rocket science and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training the truth is wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring they don t want the competetion and they sure as hell don t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they d charge you forty or fifty dollars they make their money only if you believe two lies  that investing is too difficult and risky for the average person  that using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade here is what the financial gurus in today s society absolutely positively do not want you to know the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it provided they spend a few hours of studying after reading over  financial books and publications during the past decade and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market i ve learned the following lessons achieving financial success is incredibly simple anyone can do it it only takes a few hours to learn when i discovered the secret to day trading i didn t become wealthy overnight if you want instant cash drive to wal mart buy a ski mask and a shotgun and rob your local bank the only way to get rich quick or otherwise is through hard work knowledge and determination after learning the fundamentals of day trading i started practicing the trading art itself and the first few weeks brought modest gains the next few months gave me the practical experience i needed to really earn a living and i was pulling close to a six figure income in less than three years with no formal financial training minimal effort and only moderate risk i had made my first million the knowledge that i gained during those formative trading years i am willing to share with you in my new book the master trader you will learn from my mistakes and from my successes as i teach you the simple secret formula for day trading that i ve used profitably year after year the income of the day trader can

training and false positives and install it as a filter a more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can easily be used by individuals since we re more likely to find individuals willing to risk this than postmasters my impression is that a pre collected corpus would not fit most individuals very well but each individual or group should collect their own corpus one problem that comes upp immediately individuals are lazy if i currently get  spam and  ham a day and i ll have to press the delete button once for each spam i ll be happy to press the spam button instead however if in addition have to press a ham button for each ham it starts to look much less like a win to me add the time to install and setup the whole machinery and i ll just keep hitting delete the suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete action that adds a message to the ham corpus i see two problems with this the ham will be a bit skewed mail that i keep around without deleting will not be counted secondly if i by force of habit happen to press the delete key instead of the spam key i ll end up with spam in the ham anyways i would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham the obvious thing to do is to trigger on the spam button and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one in the ham corpus and simply remove them to do this we need a way to compare two word count histograms to see how similar they are any ideas also i personally would prefer to not see the spam at all if they get bounced preferably already in the smtp false positives become the senders problem to rewrite to remove the spam smell in a well tuned system then there spam corpus will be much smaller than the ham corpus so it would be possible to be slightly over agressive when clearing potential spam from the ham corpus this should make it easier to keep it clean having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus there s less need to worry about it getting there by mistake and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus that didn t get deleted by the spam filtering it might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from the spam

concerned about some particular bit of email policy for  ok after much fiddling with and tweaking of etc exim exim conf and etc exim local_scan py on  i am fairly confident that i can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment s notice for the record here s how it all works exim conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file etc exim harvest does not exist that is any junk mail condition that can be detected by exim acls access control lists is handled entirely in exim conf the message is rejected before it ever gets to local_scan py this covers such diverse cases as message from known spammer reject after every rcpt to command no message id header and  bit chars in subject both rejected after the message headers body are read the main things i have changed in the absence of etc exim harvest are don t check for  bit chars in from header the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some asian isp the remaining hits should be handled by spamassassin do header sender verification ie ensure that there s a verifiable email address in at least one of from reply to and sender as late as possible because it requires dns lookups which can be slow and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred if those dns lookups timeout if etc exim harvest exists then the behaviour of all of those acls in exim conf suddenly changes instead of rejecting recipients or messages they add an x reject header to the message this header is purely for internal use it records the name of the folder to which the rejected message should be saved and also gives the smtp error message which should ultimately be used to reject the message thus those messages will now be seen by local_scan py which now looks for the x reject header if found it uses the folder name specified there to save the message and then rejects it with the smtp error message also given in x reject currently x reject is retained in saved messages if a message was not tagged with x reject then local_scan py runs the usual virus and spam checks namely my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows executables and a run through spamassassin the logic is basically this if virus folder virus else run through spamassassin if score   folder rejected spam elif score   folder caught spam finally local_scan py writes the message to the designated folder by far the biggest folder will be accepted the server handles   incoming messages per day of which maybe   are junk mail oops just realized i haven t written the code that actually saves the message d ohh also haven t written anything to discriminate personal email which i must do sigh finally the big catch waiting until after you ve read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic because certain broken mtas including those used by some spammers don t consider a xx after data as a permanent error but keep retrying d ohh this is a minor annoyance currently where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time but in harvest mode everything with the exception of people probing for open relays will be rejected at data time so i have cooked up something called the asbl or automated sender blacklist this is just a berkeley db file that maps sender_ip sender_address to an expiry time when local_scan rejects a message from sender_ip sender_address for whatever reason including finding an x reject header added by an acl in exim conf it adds a record to the asbl with an expiry time  hours in the future meanwhile there s an acl in exim conf that checks for records in the asbl if there s a record for the current sender_ip sender_address that hasn t expired yet we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body the downside of this from the point of view of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming  one smtp connection per address we will most likely only get one copy this is a win if

a face push while the bisch gets a thursady night special  min heel push thus furthing the story arc of the brand split rosey and jamala get heat and b and c get a new tag team to play with ricco who

datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august     am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xa xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xg that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xa accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xa is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to  times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xg execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first  bytes of a packet while the xa provides deeper packet inspection looking at   bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the u high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xa can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may and earlier this month tarari an intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now available priced starting at   the company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early  by eugene kuznetsov a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks long before industry interest in xml grew kuznetsov assembled a team of world class m i t engineers and designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing xml the first such solution was a software interpreter called dgxt this software based approach to xml processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software based accelerators kuznetsov s team raised the bar and designed a system for processing xml in purpose built hardware in  datapower s effort produced xml generation three xg the industry s fastest technology for xml processing bar none today xg technology powers the industry s first wire speed xml network devices enabling secure high speed applications and xml web services

of mass destruction etc etc  september   senate committee passes nanotech bill by roy mark the senate commerce committee unanimously passed on thursday legislation to promote nanotechnology research and development introduced by sen ron wyden d ore the st century nanotechnology research and development act would create the national nanotechnology research program the bill is co sponsored by sen joe lieberman d conn and sen george allen r va the proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would support long term nanoscale research and development and promote effective education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and professionals the unanimous support of the senate commerce committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology lieberman who vowed to pushed to full senate passage before the end of the year said nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology the u s certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing this technology our legislation will provide the nation with a long term focus and sustained commitment and facilitate new collaborations between government academia and industry that will ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation the bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology program under the national science and technology council it would also create a presidential national nanotechnology advisory panel and national nanotechnology coordination office which would provide administrative and technical support for the advisory panel and the council my own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to change america on a scale equal to if not greater than the computer revolution i am determined that the united states will not miss but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology wyden said in introducing the bill at present efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a half dozen federal agencies i want america to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world s leader in this burgeoning field and i believe federal support is essential to achieving that goal to study the potential long term effects of nanotechnology a new center for societal ethical educational legal and workforce issues related to nanotechnology would also be established according to lieberman the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the national research council nrc which completed a thorough review of the national nanotechnology initiative in june those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel emphasizing long term goals striking a balance between long term and short term research supporting the development of research facilities equipment and instrumentation creating special funding to support research that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs promoting interdisciplinary research and research groups facilitating technology transition and outreach to industry conducting studies on the societal implications of nanotechnology including those related to ethical educational legal and workforce issues and the development of metrics for measuring progress toward program goals ', 'url  date not supplied japanese

too little i have is not so much too slow as inefficient with factory settings it would actually crash from running too hot and too fast accelerating the ami and possibly openuae graphics is a

unless you ve got an angle on making money on service from amigans one excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs behind the amlcd thus using the backside of the display half as a radiator though it interferes with the case notion below yes aavid or such makes some as a standard part i prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative mass in elevating the laptop i e in the form of a catch handle and second logo device behind the laptop which generally provides stow and attachment for elevation legs move them out farther to get to the next higher ekevation until the sides of the laptop are met this also happens to provide a little protection for usb  and  cables that i tend to keep plugged in all the time a bit longer port life please  a case color other than brown or

the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of legitimacy people tricked into clicking on fake sites but a spokesman for ncis said fake or spoof websites are now being used in place of the certificates to many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web technology said the spokesman one of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the south african reserve bank the country s national bank typically victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has been deposited in their name but before they can get their hands on the cash the victims are typically asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead once the south african police discovered the ruse they declared it a national priority crime and soon arrested the  people behind it modern gloss an

natural mothers to feed them unfortunately for her one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while kamuniak slept the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by their natural mothers the wardens think the latest adoptee nicknamed naisimari taken by force was adopted at the weekend she must have adopted her on sunday because they are in harmony said gabriel lepariyo a warden

lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through three walls to steal   worth of cigarettes recently in an attack which was well planned and professional the paper reports the thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition between the back hallway and the front shop moving statues of religious icons

start with a bunch of messages that don t exist i m not sure why it is important that the first message in the sequence returned exists but not necessarily any of the others but i m sure glad it is as mhseqexpand gets called lots and i don t know if i could cope if it were checking every file in the sequences it is looking at all the time although my fingerprints are all over that it s not actually my code and has been in there since before  it s code that i moved from mh tcl to sequences tcl and back again i m no sure either but it should be a one time penalty because the sequence will be re written with the bad messages removed i think it may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current folder though that would then need to be verified against changes to the directory does tcl have a directory read function i assume so mh_sequence also goes and rereads the files mh_sequences and the context file but i m not sure how frequently that one is called that was a problem but if you look at mh_sequence and mh_sequences and mh_sequenceupdate they all call mhreadseqs to do the actual reading and it only reads the sequences if the file has been touched look for the

going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august     am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xa xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xg that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xa accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xa is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to  times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xg execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first  bytes of a packet while the xa provides deeper packet inspection looking at   bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the u high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xa can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may and earlier this month tarari an intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now available priced starting at   the company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early  by eugene kuznetsov a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks long before industry interest in xml grew kuznetsov assembled a team of world class m i t engineers and designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing xml the first such solution was a software interpreter called dgxt this software based approach to xml processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software based accelerators kuznetsov s team raised the bar and designed a system for processing xml in purpose built hardware in  datapower s effort produced xml generation three xg the industry s fastest technology for xml processing bar none today xg technology powers the industry s first wire speed xml network

traffic and transactions at the wire speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services and other xml centric initiatives datapower s solutions are based on its patent pending xml generation three xg technology enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter and intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type datapower s xml acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of xml that is required to support next generation enterprise applications said eugene kuznetsov cto and founder of datapower technology datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s critical to web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance a single datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of  servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment in addition the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security protection against xml based denial of service attacks connection of e business protocols for incompatible xml data streams load balancing between back end servers and

two parts originally web servers just understood http and sent pages then the field started demanding more from the web and the servers got loaded down with cgi and mod_perl and active pages and stuff so now the web server can choose to go back to simple serving and where the application is appropriate let the client do the other razzamatazz this is superior to javascript in one important detail the program doesn t have to reload when a new page is loaded as javascript functions do and because xdegrees uses web compatible technology users can access xdegrees resources without installing any

mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers xdegrees will colocate servers at key routing

friends are supposed to be good for you in recent years scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless they are even less susceptible to the common cold studies show but not all friends have such a salutary effect some lie insult and betray some are overly needy some give too much advice psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends friendship is often very painful said dr harriet lerner a psychologist and the author of the dance of connection in a close enduring friendship jealousy envy anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads one has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and i m disbanding it another book when friendship hurts by dr jan yager a sociologist at the university of connecticut at stamford advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside there s this myth that friendships should last a lifetime dr yager said but sometimes it s better that they end that social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all marriage and family relationships between siblings or parents and children have been seen as more important of course troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are and children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad as a popular author of relationship advice books dr lerner said never once have i had anyone write and say my best friend hits me dr beverley fehr a professor of psychology at the university of winnipeg noted that sociological changes like a  percent divorce rate have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health now that a marital relationship can t be counted on for stability the way it was in the past and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy said dr fehr the author of friendship processes until the past couple of years the research on friendship focused on its health benefits now we re starting to look at it as a more full relationship said dr suzanna rose a professor of psychology at florida international university in miami like marriage friendship also has negative characteristics the research is in its infancy psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship dr fehr said so far they have only through surveys and interviews figured out that it is a significant problem the early research dr fehr added is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought how can a friend be bad most obviously dr rose said by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill advised pursuit when you think of people who were friends at enron she added you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior betrayal also makes for a bad friendship when friends split up said dr keith e davis a professor of psychology at the university of south carolina it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential another form of betrayal dr yager said is when a friend suddenly turns cold without ever explaining why it s more than just pulling away she said the silent treatment is actually malicious at least as devastating is an affair with the friend s romantic partner as recently happened to one of dr lerner s patients i would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out dr lerner said a third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person dr yager said one of the  people who responded to dr yager s most recent survey on friendship described how when she was  her best friend called her a derogatory name the woman now  was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since dr yager said emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse but it is more insidious dr yager said some people constantly set up their friends she explained they ll have a party not invite the friend but make sure he or she finds out risk takers betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends dr yager said but they are not the only ones she identifies  different varieties occupying the second tier of badness are the liar the person who is overly dependent the friend who never listens the person who meddles too much in a friend s life the competitor and the loner who prefers not to spend time with friends most common is the promise breaker this includes everyone from the person who says let s have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them but then isn t dr yager said some friendships go bad as some romantic relationships do when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one with couples it can take  to  months for someone to discover there s something important they don t like about the other person said dr rose of florida international one might find for example that in subtle ways the other person is a racist in friendships which are less intense it may take even more time for one person to meet the other s dislike criteria whether a friendship is worth saving dr lerner said depends on how large the injury is sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go she added it s also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person s limitations acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses dr lerner said because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one but if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress the healthy response is to pull away dr yager said to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life and start being too busy to get together ever it takes two people to start and maintain a friendship but only one to end it dr yager said friendship because it is voluntary and unregulated is far easier to dissolve than marriage but it is also comparatively fragile experts say ideally the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones dr lerner said it is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you re healthy and your life and work are going well she said because when a crisis hits when someone you love dies or you lose your job and your health insurance when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability you will discover how crucial and life preserving good friendship is  how to advertise for information on advertising in e mail

that are deemed gab thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary gab government board as it was posted to discussion i gab thought there d be some gab instead it s a post gazette column by brian o neill gab lamenting the fact that some people know how to gab fill out a permit so that they can take advantage gab of their right to peaceable assembly obviously gab he s poking fun at the idea that specific groups gab get specific zones and that it s not up to the gab police to decide what messages and signs get put into gab what zones to most expediently keep order oh thats right greg because was explicitly clear that the pro bush folks went out and did the permit dance so where in the article is this again lets get something straight here this is a first amendment issue public streets provided one isn t blocking traffic generally tend to be sorta ok at least from my last interpretation of con law a few years ago i ll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have changed and the specific facts in this case are weak if this guy _was_ merely holding a sign which it seems was the case for all the pro bush folks he did nothing wrong he certainly didn t do enough of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge i ll play with your perspective though lets assume a few things if i walk into the city office and tell them i want to peacably assemble against bush do you think they ll give me a permit probably not so i lie then the cop does what happened in this scenario he walks up checks my permit and finds out that i falsified my statement to get this said document he arrests me end of story gab the problem is that politics have gotten so muddied gab nowadays that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting gab political rallies that you don t agree with has become gab common practice the courts have constantly ruled gab that there are some restrictions on the first amendment gab they teach you that your very first year of law school i ll agree with owen on this one muddied my ass how hard is it to chose between a republocrat or a demipublican not very shouting down has grown to become the answer because the government over a span of years and with the help of the courts has limited the rights we have as citizens under the first amendment if you question the policy about terrorism or drugs or iraq or bush in general you re aiding terrorism if you challenge the beliefs of the folks attending the various shadowy g conferences you re an anarchist and you re herded off to a designated protest spot miles away from anything part of the point of speech is to be heard i can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere and while thats speech its not effective speech people are screaming and shouting over the political figures because they cannot be heard in any other way gab i think that given the information as laid out by the story gab mr o neill has confused free speech with action free gab speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost gab every american seems to involve the ability to communicate gab an idea to an unknown audience action involves directing gab a specific comment to a specific well defined individual or audience gab that has immediate harmful and sometimes physical gab effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person getting back to my original point how do you communicate an idea to an unknown audience if you re miles from where the audience is how do you bypass the rules for being miles away from the audience without violating the rules of the regime i don t think mr nell was throwing pies at bush a sign the last time i checked didn t cause physical injury or even emotional harm if i remember cohen v california  u s   its not the individual speaking that has the

that advertising has to strive to get your attention early so for example if we only bothered to tokenize the first  of a msg would results get worse neil schemenauer spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning of the message in pratice that would probably work fine note that  s current tokenizer only looks at decoded text mime sections or raw message text if no mime exists spammers could put megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn t even be looked at except that the email package has to parse non text parts well enough to skip over them and tokens for the most interesting parts of content type disposition transfer encoding decorations are generated for all mime sections schemes that remain ignorant of mime are vulnerable to spammers putting arbitrary amounts of nice text in the preamble area after the headers and before the first mime section which most mail readers don t display but which appear first in the file so are latched on to by graham s scoring scheme but i don t worry about clever spammers i ve seen no evidence that they exist   wink even if they do the open source zoo is such that no particular scheme will gain dominance and there s no percentage for spammers in trying to fool just one scheme even if they did for the kind of scheme we re using here they can t know what nice text is not unless they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their messages to each different one at that point they d be doing targeted marketing and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously if you

suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past  months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever  year old the e mail letter listed  addresses and contained instructions to send one  dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within  weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the  address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing  bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had  magazine and about  envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the  bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for  time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at  fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title  section  and  or title  section  in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume  sections  and  which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyx this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on how to for a five dollar fee this is the end of the media release if you would like to understand how the system works and get

expressed matters a which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past certainly not christianity islam etc hence the qualifier current b how it is currently being expressed amounts to a tacit acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and people s self limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive expression this leads to the point that religion and less sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix it also tends to invoke the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of society the tacit acknowledgement and self limiting you speak of is not a given or a function of sophistication but is primarily a feature of current western civilization of course sophisticated and western civilization are essentially equivalent imho but it need not be so d the northern ireland protestant vs catholic feud recently more or less concluded is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated by splitting society too much along religious lines one post article pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools government political party etc of course both cases have a heritage of british conquest but who doesn t and sometimes the religious component is a faÃ§ade for an equally dangerous ethnic affiliation hindu extremism isn t about the hindu religious theology as far as i can see it is a peg to hang an ethnic identity and identity politics on muslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology northern ireland is a british province of green valleys and cloud covered hills whose   million people are politically and religiously divided about  percent of the population is protestant and most protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part of britain the roman catholic minority is predominantly republican or nationalist they want to merge with the republic of ireland to the south yep all because the scots ate oats and starved their irish out long ago while the english preferred wheat and that doesn t grow so well in ireland that and the introduction of potatoes saved the irish as irish that s fine as it would be an inappropriate concentration it would be difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way i d be happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there

well developed with highest bidders for while i think that the most important issue which is that end users won t be able to fix their systems is almost passed over i know that you know this and you allude to it but your essay is getting passed around so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others there s one other point which you don t make which i think is very important which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can t happen without libraries of available vulnerability code i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped uninvited about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples in the open that you can define a set and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure we wouldn t have stackguard its nissus or snort and the security admin s job would be a lot harder adam on thu aug   at   am  eugen leitl wrote eugen leitl a href  leitl a ______________________________________________________________

hazards on august th an entity known as idefense sent out an announcement which is appended to this email briefly idefense which bills itself as a global security intelligence company is offering cash for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software that are not publicly known especially if you promise not to tell anyone else if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue it will pose a very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure at the moment the dominant paradigm for computer security research known as full disclosure people who discover security vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem they publish the information including code to exploit the vulnerability if possible this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by cert in the late s which its proponents might call responsible disclosure never release working exploit code and never release any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released a patch this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked on features and often even after the patches were released people wouldn t apply them because they didn t know how serious the problem was the underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible disclosure process kept their victims who had no connections in the underground vulnerable the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known are much less dangerous because their victims can take steps to reduce their potential impact including disabling software turning off vulnerable features filtering traffic in transit and detecting and responding to intrusions they are therefore much less useful to would be intruders also software companies usually see security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems and so prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as long as possible idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous than either of the two previous paradigms they want to be a buyer in a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information rewarding discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash not long before snosoft a group of security researchers evidently including some criminal elements apparently made an offer to sell the secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software vendor specifically they apparently made a private offer to hewlett packard to keep a vulnerability in hp s tru unix secret if hp retained snosoft s consulting services hp considered this extortion and responded with legal threats and snosoft published the information if this is allowed to happen it will cause two problems which together add up to a catastrophe first secret software vulnerability information will be available to the highest bidder and to nobody else for reasons explained later i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime syndicates although that will not be obvious to the sellers second finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will become lucrative for many more talented people the result will be just as in the responsible disclosure days that the good guys will remain vulnerable for months and years while the majority of current vulnerabilities are kept secret i ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the vendors of the vulnerable software but i don t think that s plausible if someone can steal   because a software bug lets them the software vendor is never held liable often in fact the people who administer the software aren t liable either when credit card data are stolen from an e commerce site for example knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web site administrator some time and it might save the software vendor some negative pr but it can net the thief thousands of dollars i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability information is most lucrative the thieves who can use it to execute the largest heists without getting caught inevitably that means organized crime syndicates although the particular gangs who are good at networked theft may not yet exist there might be the occasional case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remote root hole in samba for example right now people who know how to find security exploits are either motivated by personal interest in the subject motivated by the public interest motivated by a desire for individual recognition or personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits creating a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly increase the availability of that information to the people who can afford to pay the most for it spies terrorists and organized crime let s not let that happen this is the original idefense announcement from sunil james mailto sjames  sent wednesday august     pm subject introducing idefense s vulnerability contributor program greetings idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability contributor program vcp the vcp pays contributors for the advance notification of vulnerabilities exploit code and malicious code idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp the following provides answers to some basic questions about the program q how will it work a idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish security research for compensation rather it could be for any of a number of motivations including the following pure love of security research the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks the desire to urge vendors to fix their products the publicity that often accompanies disclosure the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the internet community but who would also like to be paid for doing the work the compensation will depend among other things on the following items the kind of information being shared i e vulnerability or exploit the amount of detail and analysis provided the potential severity level for the information shared the types of applications operating systems and other software and hardware potentially affected verification by idefense labs the level of exclusivity if any for data granted to idefense q who should contribute to the vcp a the vcp is open to any individual security research group or other entity q why are you launching this program a timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence contributions to some lists take time before publication to the public at large more often many of these services charge clients for access without paying the original contributor under the idefense program the contributor is compensated idefense labs verifies the issue and idefense clients and the public at large are warned in a timely manner q who gets the credit a the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or exploit information q when can i contribute the vcp is active you are welcome to begin contributing today to learn more go to  if you have questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the vcp please contact us at contributor  regards sunil james technical analyst idefense

funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a hindu god in the southern indian state of andhra pradesh the monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over zealous worshippers the animal was cremated in anantapur district  kilometres  miles south of the state capital hyderabad on sunday it had not eaten for three weeks last rites were performed by priests in the village of timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the hindu monkey god hanuman garlanded one animal rights activist said his group s efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people the monkey s death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple but were prevented by villagers the monkey which was found perched on top of an idol of hanuman a month ago attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages as well as from the neighbouring state of karnataka devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock exploited locals said they believed that lord hanuman was visiting the village as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents but animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated they filed a petition in the state s high court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple the group also alleged that people s religious feelings were being exploited to make money the court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey but villagers prevented officials from taking him for

fer crissakes so the following article comes recommended a fine explanation of michael powell s extraordinary equivocation on the other hand i can also agree with werbach s werblog entry rohit a trip to f c c world nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc chairman michael powell it s one of the first articles i ve seen that captures some of powell s real personality and the way he s viewed in washington unfortunately lemann ends by endorsing conventional political wisdom after describing how powell isn t really a fire breathing ideological conservative he concludes that in essence powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants i know that s not how powell sees the world and though i disagree with him on many issues i think he s right to resist the old dichotomy the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who went through it the disaster wasn t the regulators fault as some conservatives argue but something clearly went horribly wrong and policy makers should learn from that experience contrary to lemann s speculation the upstart carriers won t be successful in a gore administration because it s too late virtually all of them are dead and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable future some may survive but as small players rather than world dominators the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is old news the next important battle in telecom will be between those who want to stay within the traditional boxes and those who use different models entirely that s why open broadband networks and open spectrum are so important whatever the regulatory environment there is going to be consolidation in telecom those left out in that consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into the home or slowly die the victors in the consolidation game will cut back on innovation and raise prices which will create further pressure for alternatives lemann is right that policy making looks much drier and more ambiguous on the ground than through the lens of history but he s wrong in thinking that telecom s future will be something like its past friday october      am comments   the chairman by nicholas lemann he s the other powell and no one is sure what he s up to new yorker october   last year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first fairly serious american history course indignantly reported that the whole subject was incomprehensible i was shocked what about gettysburg and the declaration of independence and the selma to montgomery march just look at my textbook he said and when i did i saw his point his class had got up to the eighteen forties what i expected was a big beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks and in deed there was some of that but the main difference between my son s text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american history there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements i skipped ahead past the civil war hoping for easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal government s main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests even now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington what you d find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real estate banks versus insurance companies and so on the arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them it s an insider s game less because the players are secretive than because the public and the press encouraged by the players who speak in jargon can t get themselves interested one corner of washington might be called f c c world for the federal communications commission f c c world has perhaps five thousand denizens they work at the commission itself at the house and senate commerce committees and at the washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates they read communications daily subscription price   a year and every year around christmastime they grumblingly attend the chairman s dinner at a washington hotel where the high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly self deprecating comedy routine by the commission s chairman of all the federal agencies and commissions the f c c is the one that americans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the american economy as well as important aspects of daily life telephone and television and radio and newspapers and the internet and right now f c c world is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the f c c qwest worldcom adelphia and global crossing among others are or were part of f c c world aol time warner is part of f c c world jack grubman the former salomon smith barney analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay of enron as the embodiment of the corporate scandals is part of f c c world in the past two years companies belonging to f c c world have lost trillions of dollars in stock market valuation and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market this year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the f c c has been circulating widely within f c c world it evokes f c c world s feverish mood the f c c is fiddling while rome burns and suggests why nobody besides residents of f c c world has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals the sentence i just quoted is followed by this explanation the ilecs appear likely to enter all l d markets within twelve months while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since  and suffering about  market share loss in business lines to clecs it s a lot easier to think about evil c e o s than to decipher that even in good times f c c world pays obsessive attention to the commission s chairman in bad times the attention becomes especially intense and when the chairman is a celebrity f c c world devotes itself to full time chairman watching the current chairman michael powell is a celebrity at least by government official standards because he is the only son of colin powell the secretary of state unlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which generates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about who he really is and what he s really up to powell is young to be the head of a federal agency he is thirty nine and genially charming everybody likes him before becoming chairman he was for three years one of the f c c s five commissioners not only is he fluent in the f c c s incomprehensible patois he has a clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy he s always saying that he s an avid moderate and yet he has a rage inciting quality one of his predecessors as chairman reed hundt quoted in forbes compared powell to herbert hoover mark cooper of the consumer federation of america calls him radical and extreme just as often as he s accused of being a right wing ideologue powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious it ain t about singing kum ba yah around the campfire another former chairman william kennard says you have to have an answer one day last spring powell testifying before a senate subcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the subcommittee s chairman ernest hollings of south carolina berated him you don t care about these regulations hollings said you don t care about the law or what congress sets down that s the fundamental that s the misgiving i have of your administration over there it just is amazing to me you just pell mell down the road and seem to not care at all i think you d be a wonderful executive vice president of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level are you happy in your job extremely powell said with an amiable smile one cannot understand powell s maddening effect at least on democrats and liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose the f c c was created by congress in  but it existed in prototype well before the new deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves its other original function was preventing american telephone telegraph the national monopoly phone company from treating its customers unfairly over the decades as f c c world grew up into a comfortable well established place the f c c segued into the role of industrial supervision its real purpose it was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didn t become too bloody by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business in addition to looking out for the public s interest the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of congress many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest group you can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster according to an oft told f c c world anecdote president clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because he said if the so and so who owned the anti clinton little rock democrat gazette had owned the leading tv station in little rock too clinton would never have become president f c c world may have been con tentious but it was settled too because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves then in the nineteen eighties the successful breakup of a t t by far the biggest and most important company the commission regulated deposited a thick additional sediment of self confidence onto the consciousness of f c c world a generation ago for most americans there was one local phone company one long distance company and one company that manufactured telephones which customers were not permitted to own and they were all the same company it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line by the mid nineteen nineties there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies a handful of national long distance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers and millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines a t t had argued for years that it was a natural monopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines so much for that argument over the same period the f c c had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the internet it was the dream of federal agency success come true consumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more prosperous too the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of  one of those massive endlessly lobbied over pieces of legislation which most people outside f c c world probably felt it was safe to ignore although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interest group bargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers as baby bells and to f c c world as arbocks the pronounced version of rbocs or regional bell operating companies would be permitted to offer long distance service in exchange for letting the long distance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers consumers would win because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance but the politics and economics of the telecom act which was shepherded through congress by vice president gore were just as important democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology party the party that brought the internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the party s new contributor base clinton s slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to the twenty first century which like all clinton slogans artfully sent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical correlates of the telecom act and gore s cruise to the presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the act s success the f c c had a crucial role in all this the arbocks are rich aggressive politically powerful and generally republican though like all important interest groups they work with both parties they immediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years through rule making enforcement and litigation the f c c then headed by reed hundt who was gore s classmate at st albans was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages so that not only long distance companies like a t t and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new companies see lecks the pronounced version of clecs or competitive local exchange carriers could emerge this entailed the regulatory equivalent of hand to hand combat the see leck is supposed to have access to the arbock s switching equipment the arbock won t give the seeleck a key to the room where it s kept so the see leck asks the f c c to rule that the arbock has to give it the key partly because hundt assured the see lecks and other new companies that he would protect them and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the see lecks companies with names like winstar covad and teligent and into other telecommunications companies even not obviously related technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the see lecks and other new players there would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundt s former lieutenants told me reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had its blood up and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies time warner and aol decided to throw in together and a t t and comcast and so on surely worldcom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their self dealing stock overselling and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating by the time the outcome of the  presidential election had been determined the telecom crash was well under way nonetheless the chairmanship of the f c c remained one of the best jobs in terms of influence and visibility available to a career government regulator three republicans emerged as candidates powell who was a commissioner harold furchtgott roth the farthest to the right commissioner and patrick wood the head of the texas public utility commission and as such a george w bush guy in texas however wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp edward whitacre the c e o of s b c communications which is headquartered in san antonio this meant that the arbocks didn t want wood as head of the f c c because he might be too pro see leck wood is now the head of the federal energy regulatory commission michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasn t as threatening as wood while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than furchtgott roth powell did this deftly for example in december of  he appeared before a conservative group called the progress freedom foundation and gave a very michael powell speech whimsical intellectual and free associative biblical history joseph schumpeter moore s law that began by making fun of the idea that the f c c should try to keep new telecom companies alive in the wake of the  act the f c c is often cast as the grinch who stole christmas powell said like the whos down in who ville who feast on who pudding and rare who roast beast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act s fertile soil but this feast the f c c grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thus powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didn t expect to administer first aid to the see lecks as part of the job he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the bush administration twenty months into the administration nearly all the see lecks are dead or dying nearly all long distance companies not just worldcom are in serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite companies are staggering the crash has had an automatically concentrating effect because as new companies die the existing companies market share increases and if the existing companies are in good shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices during the bush administration as the financial carnage in communications has worsened the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration if the bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and if they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service verizon in the east and s b c in the west and these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the poor health of the long distance companies the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies aol time warner and comcast unlike the phone companies they don t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter people s homes as part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the  telecom act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened and in the past six years the number of radio station owners in the united states has been cut by twenty five per cent today a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company westwood one a subsidiary of viacom in this situation many democrats and liberals think the f c c should be hyperactive the superhero of government regulation springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry it should try to breathe life into the see lecks and other new companies it should disallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration it should use the government s money and muscle to get new technology especially fast internet connections into the homes of people who can t afford it at current market prices an analogy that a lot of people in f c c world make is between telecom and the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush people because they disengaged when they came into office and the bush people blame it on the clinton people because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions but michael powell s f c c has not been hyperactive powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the f c c and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him signals in mid september powell finally initiated a formal review of the f c c s limits on media concentration this doesn t mean he has been inactive rather he has been active in a way that further infuriates his critics in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of f c c world really make sense while giving the impression that he s having the time of his life as chairman at his first press conference when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital divide that is economic inequality in access to the internet he said you know i think there is a mercedes divide i d like to have one and i can t afford one at the national cable telecommunications association convention in chicago powell following a troupe of tumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powell in his office at the f c c until  when the commission moved to a new building in southwest washington near the city s open air fish market f c c world was at the western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars today the f c c building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park even the chairman s suite though large is beige carpeted and fluorescent powell is a bulky man who wears gold rimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in germany in  when he was an army officer because of the accident he left the army and went to law school where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly the idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the fact prophylactically as he likes to say should wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them he worked briefly at a corporate law firm and then became a protÃ©gÃ© of joel klein the head of the antitrust division of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government s legal case against microsoft he was recently appointed chancellor of the new york public school system it testifies to powell s political skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush administration who not only served in the clinton administration but also maintains close ties to bush s nemesis senator john mccain of arizona one of the things about powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law school it s sort of like a law school study session over there one democratic former commissioner said as if to confirm the charge powell when i arrived introduced me to four law students summer interns at the commission whom he d invited to sit in i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the f c c for example could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved i think we ll never know powell said i don t think it s an automatically bad idea the way some people will argue land is probably the best analogue we don t seize all the land in the united states and say the government will issue licenses to use land if my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line there s a whole body of law about what i can do about that including whether i can tear it down if a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company it s a similar proposition there are scholars who argue indeed the famous ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about this that spectrum policy is lunacy the market could work this out in the kinds of ways that we re accustomed to talking to powell was fun unlike most high government officials he doesn t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding he slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs he speaks in ironic air quotes he s like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical after a while i asked him whether he thought his predecessors excitement about the  telecommunications act had been excessive i would start with a caveat powell said look i can t fault those judgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities but frankly i ve always been a little bit critical first of all anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn t come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the president on down about the kinds of things it s going to open up i mean i don t know what provisions are the information superhighway provisions or what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction when one starts reading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions but nonetheless there was a rising dot com excitement and an internet excitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it certainly was but we were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble it was a dramatically exaggerated expectation by the leadership of the commission by politicians by the market itself by companies themselves it was a gold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones that government encouraged by its policies frankly everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act i want to see ten competitors twenty competitors i want to see thirty per cent market share fifty per cent market share i want the bells to bleed then we ll know we ve succeeded now powell returned to being powell i think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic in the short term they wanted to see it while they re there we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking and the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking there s no question we went too soon too fast too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product or a business model how could the telecom act have been handled better we could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system powell said money chased what seemed like government promised opportunity the problem with that is there s a morning after and we re in it and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem this debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level in some ways for short term gain we paid a price in long term stability powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more reasonable level of investment no we wouldn t have every home in america with competitive choice yet but we don t anyway i don t think it s the remonopolization of telephone service i don t buy that the bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldn t the part of the story that didn t materialize was that people thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone companies he added hadn t materialized as viable businesses either and they never might everybody s always saying the regulators did this and this and this but candidly the story s quite the opposite i think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance conditions don t get that good except once every thirty years and it didn t happen so whatever the reason we re looking at a worldcom that s teetering we re looking at a long distance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base a t t is breaking itself up sprint has struggled could the f c c have done anything to make the long distance companies stronger at the f c c i think i ll just be blunt my political answer yes there s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help but i can t find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere i can t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s e c investigation were i king it would be wonderful but i don t have those kinds of levers i don t know whether anybody does at some point companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying powell couldn t have made it much clearer that he doesn t think it s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash he has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gestures in august for example five months after disbanding the f c c s accounting safeguards division powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry but that shows that powell is better at riding out the storm than say harvey pitt his counterpart at the securities and exchange commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry i asked powell if it would bother him if for most people only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service yes he said it concerns us that there s one of each of those things but let s not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things that still is a nice suite of communications capabilities even if they aren t direct analogues of each other anyway powell said before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines so there will be more choice so yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything the question is does it stay that way the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble powell either he said that people confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration which distorts markets if this were just economics it s easy if you were to say to me mike just worry about economic concentration we know how to do that the econometrics of antitrust i can tell you when a market s too concentrated and prices are going to rise the problem is other dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional take the question of if everybody s controlling what you see the assumption there is that somehow there ll be this viewpoint a monolithic viewpoint pushed on you by your media and you won t get diversity i think that s a possibility i don t think it s nearly the possibility that s ascribed to it sometimes powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias and then we have policies like here his tone went from ironic to sarcastic the fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out f c c world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he can t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulates so he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the market in order to buy himself time another is that he s carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term and doesn t want to do anything at the f c c that would diminish his chances another is that he s waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action so that he doesn t wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks in f c c world this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom after colin powell s idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and irreversible and more concentration would be just fine this is why elections matter reed hundt who isn t happy about what has become of his telecom act told me it s true that the f c c much more than say the war in afghanistan is a case in which a gore administration would be acting quite differently from the bush administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but there s no question whether communications companies have noticed the arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if gore had won next election they ll help the party that helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivals the long distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their friends now in power will stage a comeback america s present is not unrecognizably different from america s past ', 'url  date not supplied eff is looking for a

additional comments from spamassassin contrib       i ve thought about this and pm_filter needs to die i ve now tried multiple ways to make it just transparently work on   and failed if anyone has any bright ideas please jump in you see anyone upgrading from the cpan shell will get a failure on the line use extutils makemaker   quite some modules from cpan do have a line like this nowadays i think or read so somewhere respectively and the perl error message is very clear extutils makemaker version   required this is only version   at  line  because it never gets chance to reach a writemakefile line with a prereq_pm extutils makemaker   option so the cpan shell can t automatically upgrade this module i cannot think of any way around this i could think of a solution we could remove the use line and add the version to prereq_pm after writemakefile we could add the lines require extutils makemaker extutils makemaker version   to do per hand what use extutils makemaker   does automagically perl  will die with a uncaught exception from user code extutils makemaker version   required this is only version   at  line  there but we ve got a makefile but i don t know if cpan will run the make anyway to add insult to injury the pm_filter part gets run during pm_to_blib which would be fine except extutils makemaker doesn t let you write a my pm_to_blib it s non overridable so even though we could potentially copy the   extutils install pm_to_blib code somewhere into the spamassassin codebase i tried that first we can t cause the makefile to call our code we could call the preprocessor on install time that s not a very clean approach but could work we can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the makefile directly per postamble we already have a useless line pm_to_blib spamassassin doc made there adding some commands in this section gives some make warnings makefile  warning overriding commands for target pm_to_blib makefile  warning ignoring old commands for target pm_to_blib but does work not a very good solution either so i m strongly against the current use of extutils makemaker   usage if this were an apache project this would be my veto vote and really hope we can find another way the use makemaker error message is imho quite clear so i think it s ok to require the user to do a manual update of extutils makemaker before the sa installation but that s just my opinion i ll ask on makemaker  for the best solution they should know you are receiving this mail because you are on the cc list for the bug or are watching someone who is this  email is sponsored by thinkgeek

geeks traffic the first one s a doozie that s the term right it has lots of html clues that are apparently ignored the clues below are loaded with snippets unique to html like br i meant to say that they were   clues cancelled out by   clues but that s wrong too it looks i haven t grokked this part of your code yet this one has way more than  clues and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more   than   clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly   that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo that there are any   clues in here means the scheme ran out of anything interesting to look at adding in more header lines should cure that are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there the seventh was similar i scanned a bunch more until i got bored and most of them were either of the first form brief text with url followed by quoted html from website if those were text plain the html tags should have been stripped i m still confused about this part no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website i guess you get this when you click on mail this page in some browsers that html tags aren t getting stripped remains the biggest mystery to me still this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora that s an entirely different kind of experiment from the one you re trying indeed you re the only one so far to report results from trying my pickle on their own email and i never expected that to work well it s a much

revised and expanded edition published in  by dover publications inc new york city bill bennetta _________________________________________________ m ost pseudo scientists have a number of characteristics in common first and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost total isolation in the sense of having no fruitful contacts with fellow researchers the modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his part it is due he claims to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new ideas the modern pseudo scientist stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated he works in isolation he does not send his findings to the recognized journals or if he does they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent in most cases the crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance to a significant study as a consequence he finds himself excluded the journals and societies and almost universally ignored by the competent workers in his field in fact the reputable scientist does not even know of the crank s existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through non academic channels or unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature the eccentric is forced therefore to tread a lonely way he speaks before organizations he himself has founded contributes to journals he himself may edit and until recently publishes books only when he or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed privately a second characteristic of the pseudo scientist which greatly strengthens his isolation is a tendency toward paranoia there are five ways in which the sincere pseudo scientist s paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited  he considers himself a genius  he regards his colleagues without exception as ignorant blockheads everyone is out of step except himself frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity dishonesty or other base motives if they ignore him he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable if they retaliate in kind this strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels  he believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against  he has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best established theories when newton was the outstanding name in physics eccentric works in that science were violently anti newton today with einstein the father symbol of authority a crank theory of physics is likely to attack einstein in the name of newton  he often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon in many cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined terry w colvin

organized crime had killed what was the largest port in the world s richest nation now of course it s about to get worse the sins of  years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics first those in religion and now those in government as a result a large part of  million square feet of once perfectly usable office space devoted at least ostensibly to commerce will be granted away in a potlatch that only government and special interest communities or stakeholders or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho rabble call themselves this week can organize

s name commerce if they really wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government disarmed passengers the so called authority should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the market the cure to all luddism foreign and domestic government and superstitious

mega real estate to prevail this early in the game but it s going to happen sooner or later and whenever it does that will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the world trade center cheers rah  the wall street journal september   review outlook a living memorial as we write these words we can look down from our offices into the six story crater where the twin towers once stood like everyone else we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago but we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one the site of the world trade center calls forth many emotions especially today anger grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there but underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted the best expression of the spirit of new york and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working meeting shopping eating that is engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there osama bin laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery but restoring this memory is not what the discussion in new york has been about so far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown manhattan which lost   jobs when the trade center fell instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action new york s political leadership and its financial and media elites are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better more prosperous city this is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site in consultation with new york governor george pataki who is thinking primarily about his own november re election the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial the manhattan institute s steve malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial this is in essence what the pentagon has so successfully done rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial a design for which has yet to be decided a big part of the problem in new york is that the city s anti development activists know an opening when they see one they want the world trade center site and even some surrounding areas transformed into an enormous park these political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in new york into a nightmare of delay and litigation and the world trade center site is now getting the same treatment worse they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti development agenda in the name of honoring the dead one family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site we are not experts in designing war memorials but we re confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world s financial center isn t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago the great cities of europe and japan devastated in world war ii have all rebuilt and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life perhaps the most powerful is found in rotterdam the dutch port city reduced to rubble by german bombing where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be in this country the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated if you walk into nassau hall at princeton university you ll find the names of  alumni who died in the revolutionary war the war of  the civil war the spanish american war world war i world war ii korea and southeast asia no one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names in new york now it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city s future rudolph giuliani now that he s out office wants the entire  acres devoted to the memorial governor pataki has called for no structures on the footprints which being in the center of the site would severely curtail options mayor michael bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past maybe those responsible for the world trade center site will start thinking more about the next  or  years than the past  months the best

the modify time cache trick for files in many places not just exmh so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective however it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state then aren t we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view as i d written the code a few months ago we were reading the sequences file first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence this happens anywhere that we look at sequences most notably in ftoc_showsequences that seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise but i wanted my abstraction to have a separate call for what sequences are in this folder and what messages are in this sequence one option would have been to add another call to get the data off of disk but i felt that the check the modify time technique would be less error prone i like the check the modify time technique i think the biggest gains would be from augmenting ftoc_showsequences to allow a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences for all messages i

used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems midgard  a php based content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full cms redhat ccm cms java based  opencms java based  there was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength but both plone and xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation i was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on xml some took for granted that xslt was relevant to content management others took it just as for granted that xslt was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore xml almost completely i attended realizing that content management is generally used to apply to web content management but i was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was almost no consideration of the potential print pdf dimension to content other than the occasional and you can use fop to make pdf as if that was functional this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management and probably makes xml easier to ignore if html is the be all and end all of the output the honesty was refreshing phil suh complained about the state of current tools both open source and commercial and i wish i d written down what he said something like it sucks so extremely it sucks so widely and it is so generally sucking that it seems sometimes there is no hope for a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial big boys were really much more functional than open source until someone pointed out ok take some average blog software spend   on the rollout it ll scale pretty well another quote citing brendan quinn content

they posit a pre mosaic form of the laws that had evolved by time of the pentateuch in particular there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was actually specifically about man stealing selling a free man into slavery this seems bogus to me a quick check of the text indicates the the hebrew word in question is ganav which elsewhere in the pentateuch eg gen   is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things in july  i made the following comment in response to a similar claim about the real meaning of one of the ten commandments the translations since cause problems at each successive remove we have the original language versions though so this is not an issue i m sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment is thou shalt not murder rather than kill this has nothing to do with successive translations it is based on our knowledge of the meaning of the hebrew word ratsach most modern translations i ve seen translate it

reason for that any dns list white or black works only for a limited number of ips the set of unlisted ips is much larger than the set in the dns list if you have to make a binary decision to accept

point they could drop the licensing fee to  or less and make all their income off suing the spammers for copyright infringement sorry that just can t work if the habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non spam and effectively enforced enough to be absent from spam such that e g sa could assign a positive score to messages that do not have it then spammers are out of business and habeas has no one to sue there s nobody left to charge except the people who want or are forced against their will because their mail won t get through otherwise to use the mark conversely if there are enough spammers forging the mark for habeas to make all its income suing them then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed either way it seems to me that after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of cease and desist letters to clueless mom pops then either a they re out of business b they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders or c they ve both created and monopolized a market for internet postage stamps that everybody has to pay them for the latter would be quite a coup if they could pull it off they

a few years ago he might have sought a stake in the new economy he might have dreamed of becoming an ace code cracker for the cia or the national security agency or imagined toppling an empire with revolutionary software maybe he would have tried to use the internet to end world hunger but as yandziak attends his first college classes this week he s harboring different academic ambitions the ashburn native says he wants to do something more social and more interesting than working with computers besides he said while packing for a charlottesville dormitory room you can t get the chicks with that anymore the tech industry s financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of some fair weather students but now there s another consequence of the tech bust enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has come to a halt the number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell  percent in  according to a report by the computing research association and educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating with some colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins the word is out among department deans that the bust s fallout has trickled into the classroom said maria clavez president of the association of computing machinery i ve heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic declines said clavez who will become the dean of science and engineering at princeton university in january it can be hard to see this because at some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far exceeds the available space but it is going to have an effect at virginia tech enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science department will drop  percent this year to  at george washington university the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer science fell by more than half this year interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the past decade in  schools with phd programs in computer science and computer engineering granted   degrees according to the computing research association the numbers rose through  when   degrees were awarded the labor department projects that software engineering will be the fastest growing occupation between  and  with other computer related industries trailing close behind but in the short term that growth may slow based on the changes among college students for example  of the   plus undergraduates studying information technology and engineering at george mason university were computer science majors last year this year the enrollment in that major is down to  although a newly created and more general information technology major has attracted  students having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief said lloyd griffith dean of george mason s information technology and engineering school particularly with the field as it has been they don t want to spend four years on something and then not get a job freshman enrollment for the university of maryland s computer science major is expected to be about  this fall down from  last year maryland decreased its total freshman enrollment by  percent but that alone does not account for the drop said steve halperin dean of maryland s college of computer mathematical and physical sciences we are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their interest in pursuing computer science as a major halperin said that s a factual statement but i would say that at this point we don t expect to see a decrease in the number of graduates many of the kids who are no longer expressing an interest in majoring in cs would have fallen off yandziak who began at the university of virginia on saturday is not convinced that s the case he graduated in the top  percent of his class with a   grade point average and nailed the highest possible score on his advanced placement exam in computer science all of my classes have been easy for me math and sciences were always fun so i looked for professions in which i could use those things yandziak said i m just not sure i want my life to be immersed in technology i want to do something that will contribute to the practical world harris n miller president of the information technology association of america said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage there was a tremendous imbalance in the late s potentially you have the same sort of thing going on right now people are saying i don t need this kind of it training right now miller said our concern as an industry is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment down the road four years as the economy picks up once again companies are going to find themselves in a shortage situation economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices but other factors including program difficulty personal interests and social influences also come into play said judy hingle director of professional development at the american college counseling association the perception of computer science as an isolating nerdy profession is one that many in the industry have tried to squelch that stereotype went underground during the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust all the hipness is

be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the humanoid cells are in fact exo skeletally structured with more atoms per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance squared tensile strength enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel this steel effect might give bone structure and tendons dramatically several orders of magnitude more tensile strength without the need to significantly increase the weight like magnesium alloy or carbon fiber weight compared to iron spidey could even be way under weight only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted tensile strength cross sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the muscular enhancement e as for the spidey senses well they re really great but afaik e not really well explained in the comic series if the same close packing gap filling arachne molecular structure modification occurs in neural tissues and there d be no reason to think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons then what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened cerebral functions due to shorter faster stronger synapses throughout the entire nervous system since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell clearly hearing the heartbeats and other subtle clues within their normal sensory ranges but seem mystical to us for peter parker everything from air currents on his facial hairs to extremely

sensitivities the muslim groups which include the mecca based world islamic league and the paris mosque accuse the writer of insulting islam in an interview with the literary magazine lire during last year s launch of his novel plateforme lire is also on trial over the remarks which have taken on an added significance in france in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity and concern about islam

of the imams and marianne veiled marianne raped a reference to the female symbol of the french republic freedom of expression freedom of expression they and other houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the courtroom at the main law courts in central paris while intellectuals argued before the trial that houellebecq should be free to write what he wants lyon mosque rector

federation of muslims in france have joined the paris mosque in bringing houellebecq to trial france s human rights league joined them as a civil party saying houellebecq s comments amounted to islamophobia and deserved to be sanctioned as part of the league s struggle against discrimination and racism the paris mosque has hired jean marc varaut one of france s leading trial lawyers whose past clients include maurice papon the former official condemned in  for nazi era crimes against humanity for sending jews to death camps restoring blasphemy houellebecq s lawyer emmanuel pierrat argues that the case effectively re establishes the notion of blasphemy despite the fact that france as a secular state has no such law and says houellebecq s opponents want to deny him freedom of expression he also argues that the interview in lire truncated a six hour conversation and houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the article before it appeared houellebecq s publisher

press herald writer via  acton in her freezer at home lisa pierce has ground beef and roasts frozen vegetables and french fries even a couple of popsicles what she doesn t have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on nov  the moose that was rightfully hers but instead went to a neighbor the lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the york county sheriff s department to get back what she says she is owed i think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor said pierce i m a woman and he just neglected to think that i would want it the moose is gone i know that now i want to be compensated for the meat whether or not that happens is uncertain her experience though highlights a law some mainers may not be aware of but should get to know during this peak time of deer versus car accidents as the animals in their mating season come out of the woods the law is simple a big game carcass caught by a car be it a moose deer or bear goes to the person who hits it as long as a law enforcement officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident it comes up quite often in maine say officials last year there were   cases of vehicles and deer colliding on maine roads and  accidents involving moose according to mark latti spokesman for the maine warden service in a state of what   million with only   licensed hunters i don t know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a moose said latti you do have the option of keeping it which for some people can be valuable compensation for a damaged car farm grown deer meat can retail for  to  per pound in stores and a butchered or dressed moose which can t be bought or sold anywhere in maine can produce hundreds of pounds of food latti said when it comes to moose the law has been abused since its inception in  every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car that kind of hunting makes no sense to latti hitting a moose even at a slow speed is no laughing matter large adult moose can weigh up to   pounds and can be more than  feet tall since the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars their bodies often come crashing through windshields in collisions more often than not crashes like these damage the vehicle the people inside and the animal sometimes they are fatal in  latti said there were six moose related fatalities after that when the number of moose hunting permits went from   to   there were less maine had three moose related fatalities in  one in  and two this year so far said stephen mccausland spokesman for the maine public safety department pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car did not become part of that statistic early on election day but she also feels cheated by the whole situation after all her car was totaled on the morning of the accident pierce was taking her two children and a neighbor s son to school in her  dodge dynasty she said she was going along at about  mph on a well traveled road when a moose came out of nowhere by the time my brain could see moose he was part of my windshield she said pierce is well aware of the law so as she sat in the ambulance with the children being treated for cuts and bruises she thought about the moose but the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal with it so she said she wasn t able to follow up on the animal until later that day when she inquired she was told the deputy on the scene gave the fully racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor her neighbor she said subsequently offered her the moose for the  it took him to carry it away money she didn t think she should spend by the time she contacted the attorney general s office on nov  to complain about the deputy giving her moose away the neighbor s price had gone up another  for the cost of butchering  pounds of meat and when she called york county chief deputy maurice ouellette to complain that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer s fault that she didn t have it ouellette told her he could not give her cash and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in york county at that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore but wanting money ouellette said that conversation and a similar one she had with york county sheriff phil cote left pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the moose but the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to other officials it s the officer s discretion said latti and if the officer feels the person can t immediately remove the animal he s got to think of public safety and other people on the roadway if someone is worried about her children in her car the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask is if she wants the moose maine state police trooper jeremy forbes said when he arrives at accidents that involve a serious injury to a person the issue of who gets the animal deer or moose becomes secondary the priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital he said if they are really hurt and going to the hospital the animal can t wait so we ll probably give it to the next person who stops by this is not comforting to pierce she said the deputy could have come to the ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose with her boyfriend a hunter nearby she could have easily taken care of the animal herself she knows her situation is probably a lost cause but she hopes other people especially other women do not have the same experience what about people who don t know the law she said standing up for my rights has just been a big headache staff writer

seriously my name is col michael bundu of the democratic republic of congo and one of the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of congo laurent kabila of blessed memory may his soul rest in peace due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in my country i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of twenty million five hundred thousand united states dollars only us     to fight the rebel group we were then given this money privately by the then president laurent kabila without the knowledge of other cabinet members but when president kabila was killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of congo we immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in congo for safe keeping the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col rasheidi karesava one of the aides to laurent kabila a tribesman and some other military personnel from our same tribe by the new president of the democratic republic of congo the son of late president laurent kabila joseph kabila in view of this we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary we have sufficient contacts here to move the fund under diplomatic cover to a security company in europe in your name this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked confidential and it will not pass through normal custom airport screening and clearance our inability to move this money out of congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends

information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality we would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund

stops work on thier code and ask the users to put preasure on sigma to honor the gpl some notes from other places from doom  xvid development has been stopped the sigma designs realmagic mpeg  video codec contains wide portions of code taken from the xvid project soon after the initial release of the realmagic codec the xvid developers have contacted sigma and informed them about the gpl violation for those who don t know xvid is distributed under the gnu public license gpl which demands that if you modify a gpl program you have to release it under the gpl which in this case means that the source code of the sigma codec must be freely available sigma promised to replace the stolen code but the new version of the codec which was released this month only disguises the stolen code it was not actually removed sigma was once again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today nothing has happened therefore the xvid team is now turning to the public in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince sigma designs to respect the terms of the gpl and until the matter has been resolved xvid development will not continue that being said i hope all the forum members who saw their threads about the sigma codecs being closed will understand our motivation now internally we already knew what was going on but since the xvid authors first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes and kept quiet about the matter at hand update sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of the source code of their mpeg  codec and it s already up for download however not a word was lost about the xvid issue and the press release makes one think that the sigma codec was entirely developed by sigma so we might be hearing more about this update i found a gpl notice in some of the source code files but it also looks like sigma placed their own copyright lines there and xvid doesn t get any credit in the source either the gpl notice also collides with sigma s software licensing agreement that you have to sign before downloading codec or source on on the same issue divxnetworks said they d fully support xvid in this issue and apparently dxn s relationship with sigma didn t really work out either as sigma s xcard is not as divx compatible as it was advertised update first an update on the xvid situation the release of the sigma source code does not mean it s all over it s far from being over the license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download and install the codec is not compatible with the gpl furthermore it can now clearly be seen download the source code and have a look for yourself that the sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the xvid codec but all the copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and replaced this does not only violate the gpl but copyright laws you can t just take a program change a few lines and change the copyright statements you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on your own and related to this the sigma codec also contains code taken from the opendivx project the files were

old dublin song which in turn was mentioned in a pogues track billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of stoneybatter and grangegorman where i now live during the th century who discovered a new but not entirely legal way to make money blogend linktext billy in the bowl from daev hellshaw  subject the case of the stoneybatter strangler a story of my new neighbourhood the irish digest july  the case of the stoneybatter strangler the handsome deformed billy in the bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors then one night he made the biggest mistake of his life dublin in the eighteenth century was noted for two things the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin but there was one who campaigned among the working class this was billy in the bowl the strange appellation was derived from the fact that billy s sole means of transport was a large bowl shaped car with wheels seated in this bowl the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs one in each hand billy s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary as he had been born without legs nature however had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and what was most important an unusually handsome face this was billy s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers by from their small change the cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century grangegorman and stoneybatter until a servant girl or an old lady would come along he would then put on is most attractive smile which together with his black curly hair never failed to halt the females the fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity billy in the bowl however wasn t satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices gambling and drinking as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk was falling the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street on dublin s north quays when billy heard the woman s footsteps he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane as his unsuspecting victim drew close the beggar moaned and shouted and cried out for help trembling with excitement the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes in a few minutes it was all over the woman lay in a dead faint and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his bowl his victirn s purse snug in his coat pocket an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition but failed to give a description of her assailant and as billy in the bowl had figured nobody would suspect a deformed beggar again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or stoneybatter on one occasion billy in the bowl tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her the incident became known as the  grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir hundred s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months billy in the bowl was forced to desert his usual haunts around this period dublin s first ever police force was been mobilised and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder months passed and billy in the bowl reverted once again to his old pasttime a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district but the beggar still rolled along in his bowl pitied and unsuspected then came the night that finished billy s career of crime two stoudy built female cooks trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help rushing over they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch billy thinking there was only one woman grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch she proved much too strong for him however and while resisting tore at his face with her sharp finger nails meanwhile her companion acted with speed and daring pulling out her large hatpin she made for the beggar and plunged the pin into his right eye the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy billy in the bowl was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl the grangegorman stoneybatter district became once again a quiet attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night daev _______________________________ rev dave daev walsh daev  home  weekly rant  is it about a bicycle sgt pluck the

am to adam l beberg cc fork  subject re java is for kiddies adam l beberg wrote forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job i was talking about the open reqs at kana the company i work for oh but programming in java is beneath you nope just lacking years and years of it for some silly reason people always want things to be reliable fast and cross platform so all my employers have forced me to code in c c is more reliable than java as for cross platform c exists on more platforms but a java program is much easier to move from one platform to another so i m not sure what you mean i m not trying to fight a language war but i m puzzled by the depth of your anti java hatred i know lots of high school kiddies with plenty of java tho not having to teach people about pointers or optimization or anything shaves years off the coder boot time i ll send them your way when they graduate pointers so a language has to have pointers to be real and references don t count i gather what s so great about pointers why do you miss them if your doing embedded stuff fine yes you need the performance and control over memory that c provides probably but if your implementing tier n  of a tier n system and pounding against a database then java is often a very reasonable choice especially if you want that system to run without leaking memory optimization who says you can t optimize java i can and have and there are good tools that allow you to do it i use optimizeit but usually i find myself optimizing reducing database accesses instead i sped one part of the system up by a factor of ten by grouping more operations into fewer transactions but this is beside the point if you have decent c experience and have poked around in java you should be able to convince most employers that you can be trusted writing java that s what i did i mean i joined kana from microsoft and i didn t exactly write a lot of java code at microsoft i m not displeased you re trying to help just frustrated that employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills with insane years of experience i don t think i ve ever interviewed at a place where i actually met all the

it seems reasonable to think that some the participants may have actually slowed their pace a bit so while this study s summary info is incomplete you could easily conclude that the average

says very little almost nothing about the overall population behavior gay or straight and the relative prevalence of k individuals in either group but it does strongly suggest that gay males with k

who like their caricatures drawn in stark bold lines according to scuttlebutt that emerged in the british press in july  president bush britain s prime minister tony blair and france s president jacques chirac were discussing economics and in particular the decline of the french economy the problem with the french bush afterwards confided in blair is that they don t have a word for

the washington post was unable to reach baroness williams to gain her confirmation of the tale but he did receive a call from alastair campbell blair s director of communications and strategy i can

else you d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed in your specific case the excess of clues in the longer max_spamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap and that s why you didn t see anything other than   and   before adding these special lists the outcome when faced with

including zope and zeo no matter how often it says zope it gets only one   clue from doing so ditto for zeo in contrast html markup has many unique words that get   btw this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionally independent word probabilities is utterly bogus e g the probability that body appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of br appearing by treating them as independent naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink read the what about html section in  from the very start i ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at  and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context i haven t done anything geared toward personal email including the case of non mailing list email that happens to go through  i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block but as the comment block also says xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited and we ve since done several things that gave significant f n rate reductions i should test that again now are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left almost all of them apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies like content type the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject from x mailer and organization or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there i would need different data yes my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations which i may or may not be able to clean out but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i haven t changed a byte so far and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it in particular i have to skip to and received headers now and i suspect they re going to be very valuable in real life for example i don t even catch undisclosed recipients in the to header now no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora i think it s still corpus size i reported on tests i ran with random samples of  spams and  hams from my corpus that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes and while that did harm the error rates the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using  of each ah a full test run just finished on the tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code tokenize everything in the body lastw for w in word_re findall text n len w make sure this range matches in tokenize_word if  n  if w  s w w  yield w if lastw yield lastw w lastw w elif n  lastw for t in tokenize_word w yield t where word_re re compile r w x xff this at least doubled the process size over what s done now it helped the f n rate significantly but probably hurt the f p rate the f p rate is too low with only  hams per run to be confident about changes of such

the loose in britain and breeding their way towards record numbers a monitoring group has claimed the british big cats society said it has received more than  reports of animals including pumas black panthers leopards and so called fen tigers over the past  months and while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the average moggy it claims to have firm evidence that the majority are real society founder daniel bamping told bbc news online he could cope with the critics and doubters adding i was a sceptic i thought it was in the same realm as the loch ness monster but it s not they are really out there cats with cubs mr bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the country big cat reports hotspots include scotland and gloucestershire january  kent man clawed by suspected lynx november  farmer reports animals mauled by big cat april  lynx captured in north london  puma like cat attacks horse in wales this weekend alone i have had sightings from wales the scottish borders kent the west midlands devon somerset and wiltshire he said the society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals but mr bamping said others particularly lynx and puma probably exist in sufficient numbers to breed among themselves we have had sightings of cats with cubs he added trigger camera the society claims to have evidence proving the cats existence including photographs paw prints sheep kills and hair samples but it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story a national trigger camera project is planned which the society hopes will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats mr bamping said the idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and take a picture of itself like dogs the society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the wild or their descendants its spokesman danny nineham said in the s and s people had big cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs but in  when the dangerous wild animals act came into force people released their cats because they did not want to pay for a

their fundamental opposition isn t to a warmer earth it is to industrial civilization the fact that the sattelites didn t match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news the news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement rather than have to defend co concentrations as not causing global warming people who believe in co need a good explanation of the medieval warm period said period was warmer than what we have now and it obvioiusly wasn t caused by co in point of fact the predicted global warming due to co is not caused directly by co co doesn t trap that much heat water vapor does and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to co then you have your warming theory yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth s climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate more water vapor can increase temperatuers but that also leads to more clouds clouds both trap heat and reflect it so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out most
